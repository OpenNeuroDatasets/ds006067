1.65	3.68	"I'm thinking about, ""What am I going to do after this scan?"""
6.15	2.53	I definitely need to go get a coffee,
9.22	3.67	because my sleep schedule has been really screwed up since it's spring break.
13.69	8.22	I've been going to sleep a little bit too late, like 6 am and waking up at 10 am, and that's not good before the semester starts.
22.29	4.1	So, I'll get a coffee and then I'll go home, and then I need to catch up on work.
27.27	5.68	I need to do quality assurance for Elders Resilience, but I don't really know how to get started on that.
34.07	5.02	So, after I do that, maybe I'll watch some TV while I have lunch.
40.05	3.9	Maybe I'll make a good chicken wrap with Thai sauce.
44.51	3.7	And then, maybe, what should I meal-prep for the rest of the week?
48.57	5.86	I could definitely do some grain bowls or some salads or some sandwiches.
54.92	6.45	But I'm scared that if I meal-prep on Sundays, I'll get too bored of the foods Mondays through Fridays.
62.03	1.74	I wonder what TV show I'll watch.
63.79	2.14	I could start watching Criminal Minds again,
66.75	1.68	but it is a little bit boring.
68.63	2.1	But at least, on Hulu, there's advertisements
70.86	5.41	so it motivates me to do work in-between the TV show.
77.19	2.41	And then maybe I could start watching The Last of Us,
79.66	3.65	because I've heard it's pretty good and Pedro Pascal is really good in it.
84.37	4.8	Or if I want to see Pedro Pascal, maybe I'll just start watching Game of Thrones again.
89.85	4.22	But it takes too long, actually, to get to the good parts.
94.43	2.4	So maybe, I won't watch Game of Thrones.
97.51	5.44	And then after I watch TV and do quality assurance work, maybe I'll exercise.
103.49	5.9	Maybe I'll start running again, because I took a break during spring break and I need to prepare for this 10K.
109.61	1.88	And I feel like I'm out of shape again.
112.49	4.38	But it's raining, so I can't run outside, which means I'll have to run on the treadmill.
117.63	5.2	But the only treadmill that's going to be open is in Cooley or in my apartment building.
123.31	2.62	It's going to be too late to go to Bloomberg.
126.09	3.94	And if I go to Cooley, then it's fully underground and that's no fun running.
130.65	4.76	But if I go to 929, the treadmills aren't as good, so maybe I won't want to do that.
137.01	2.42	So, maybe I'll just do abs instead of running.
139.55	2.44	Then after I work out, I need to shower.
142.69	4.84	I need to make sure I have a banana, so that my muscles don't cramp up.
148.29	8.82	And then I should probably do more work, so that I can log more hours before this timesheet's period is up and so that I can get paid on time.
157.77	7.26	I also need to do the readings for Methods in Formative Research and Participant-Centered Design or whatever it's called.
165.13	4.28	I hear it's a really tough class, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
169.83	5.17	Hopefully, the readings aren't too long, so that I can actually get them done before the end of the day.
175.04	1.93	And that way, I can rest tomorrow.
177.85	1.68	Tomorrow, I have to go to Safeway.
180.41	2.46	I need to get a lot of fruit and vegetables.
182.91	4.62	Oh, and I should also look for some wraps to give me inspiration for my meal-prep.
189.15	1.9	Then on Monday, classes start.
191.95	8.98	I need to figure out if my schedule is complete or if I'm adding that humanitarian public health class.
201.29	9.06	I hear it's really good and it is only half a credit, but I'm worried that the credits won't actually match up with how much work it is.
211.15	2.42	Maybe I'll ask Sarah when she comes back.
214.11	1.99	Before she comes back, I do need to do laundry
216.13	1.82	and I need to clean the apartment.
218.49	7.78	I wonder how long she's in Mexico for and if she's going straight to DC for the half marathon or if she's coming back.
226.93	2.33	So, I need to do laundry before she gets back.
229.33	1.9	I need to make sure all my dishes are done,
231.81	12.38	and then I need to ask her if the class with Court Robinson and Spiegel is actually only 0.5 credits worth of work or if it's more, especially because it's a small class.
245.33	2.84	Then I need to think about my practicum.
248.45	11.06	Right now, I really want to go to New Zealand or Australia to work on Indigenous Health, but it's looking like that's not going to happen unless I go through the LEGO grant that the Center of Indigenous Health got.
260.22	11.31	But that's still in early stages, so will I really actually be able to go or will I be stuck in Baltimore doing work remotely for them in Australia and New Zealand?
272.61	1.59	I could go to Alaska.
274.28	1.89	That way, I'm staying in America.
276.95	2.06	But I also don't see projects in Alaska.
279.07	7.7	That would be pretty fun because I could try to go to Denali and hike the Denali, tallest mountain in North America.
287.63	6.6	And then there's only six more tallest mountains to get through on each continent, except Everest probably won't happen, so five more.
295.13	3.44	I hear the one in Antarctica is pretty small.
299.63	2.6	The one in Australia probably won't be too high too.
303.15	3.13	And a lot of people do Kilimanjaro, so I'm not worried about that one.
306.3	7.25	So, the main ones would be Denali, Kilimanjaro, Antarctica, Australia.
314.23	1.53	Everest, I won't do.
315.91	1.52	That's five.
317.71	4.56	Oh, there's probably one in Patagonia which would be pretty hard, which is six.
322.97	1.24	Which one am I missing?
325.21	0.36	Asia, North America, South America, Africa, Australia.
326.35	0.28	Oh, did I get all of them?
327.33	0.2	That's seven.
331.99	6.28	I wonder if I could actually hike Kilimanjaro and some of these smaller mountains without too much training.
339.17	11.44	I'm only in Alaska for four months maximum, since I want to come back after my practicum, and I definitely won't have time to train really hardcore for it.
352.11	5.1	I'm also hoping that since it's in the summer, it won't be too cold, so there probably won't be blizzards on the peak.
357.73	3.89	Because I remember watching the alpinist, Marc-Andr√© Leclerc.
362.3	2.62	He died, falling off a mountain.
364.94	4.99	I want to say I think it was Emperor Face, so that would have been in Canada.
370.86	7.53	But there was a blizzard at the top and an avalanche, and that's how he died, even though he's one of the most experienced alpine climbers in the world.
378.91	5.24	Or I guess he was the most experienced alpine climber in the world and he was only 24 or something.
384.91	7.04	So, maybe I'll try to climb the seven tallest mountains on each continent, minus Everest, so six.
392.35	2.28	Probably minus Patagonia, so five.
394.93	1.58	That's pretty good, five out of seven.
397.21	5.38	And if I do end up going to Australia and New Zealand, I need to make sure that I catch an All Blacks rugby game.
403.53	3.48	And I'll probably be there for the Women's World Cup, if it's over the summer.
407.79	10.08	So, I need to go to a World Cup soccer game, I need to catch an All Blacks game, I need to go surfing in Australia, I need to go to the Great Barrier Reef.
419.72	4.43	Oh, I definitely need to go to the Sydney Opera House and I need to go to the Australian Outback.
424.39	6.55	And if I'm in New Zealand, then I need to try some of the local Maori food.
431.53	1.76	Same with Australia, actually.
433.37	8.46	But if I end up in Alaska, I guess what'll be good is that it'll be an easy visa process because I already have a visa for America.
442.71	8.62	And I can fly back to Canada and I can go home, not exactly for weekends because it's still probably a six-hour flight from that far north.
452.49	4.85	But I won't really have to worry about customs and immigration, going back to New York.
458.16	3.99	And it's pretty quick, going back to Canada anyways, so I can visit my dad.
463.05	5.98	It'll be a pretty good work experience, so I can write about that on my resume for public health.
469.67	3.44	Though I'm a little bit disappointed because I'm in the Department of International Health.
473.21	4.04	And if I go to Alaska, I won't exactly be going anywhere internationally.
478.11	4.1	But it's better than if I took the NACC department because that's in Minneapolis.
482.85	1.24	Definitely America.
484.11	1.38	I'm not really counting Alaska.
485.55	7.8	I feel like Alaska and Hawaii shouldn't really count as being in America because they're so far removed and the cultures are so incredibly different.
493.43	3.02	I feel like it's just modern colonization.
497.75	3.4	I never really know if it's colonization or colonialization.
501.91	5.44	I know that I'm right in saying colonization, but I hear so many people say colonialization.
508.04	6.49	And I've heard professors say that too, it really confuses me.
514.75	2.86	Like, why would you make that?
519.11	2.9	I just really hate it when professors use words incorrectly.
522.91	2.5	There's another example that I can't really think of.
526.05	4.56	Oh, it's homogenous versus homo-genius.
532.47	1.4	It's spelled homogenous, isn't it?
533.91	2.26	And a lot of people pronounce it homo-genius.
536.51	2.96	And I've had professors pronounce it homo-genius as well.
540.33	1.72	Oh well, pronunciation is weird.
542.69	2.04	I feel like I could win a spelling bee, maybe.
544.81	6.22	I know the longest word is Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.
551.57	1.8	I couldn't tell you what the hell it means.
553.91	11.78	But there is a word, I think it's the second-longest, antidisestablishmentarianism, and it has to do with separating the church and the state in governance and stuff.
568.25	3.38	Anyways, so maybe I'll just do abs today instead of running,
571.75	2.22	because it's so gloomy outside.
574.55	2.44	That way, tomorrow, I can go for a good run.
577.13	4.6	Or instead of going for a long run, maybe I'll run to Safeway.
582.43	4.06	Or I could just walk to Safeway, that's exercise too because it's going to be such a nice day.
587.19	1.78	It's going to be 19 degrees Celsius.
590.19	2.58	I still don't know why America uses Fahrenheit.
592.87	4.14	It's such a stupid thing, especially because they're the only country that uses that system.
599.24	3.5	I get why sometimes, you may not want to use the metric system.
