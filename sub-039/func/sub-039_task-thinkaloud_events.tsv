17.28	13.64	So, definitely thinking about this loud sound that I'm hearing and everything that I'm seeing, uh, is a pretty, pretty weird, surreal experience.
31.61	4.07	Kind of reminds me of some kind of, like, spaceship or something like that.
35.89	17.16	But um, otherwise, thinking about Vittorio's talk that he's giving today, especially I'm interested in, uh, how he's gonna really frame things 'cause it's just a weird talk.
54.05	11.69	And I, I am hoping that he, uh, shows pictures of his parrot like he promised 'cause I've actually never seen it even though, uh, he's... You know, I know him so well.
67.8	8.34	Otherwise, uh, thinking about how we'll get back to campus afterwards, I'll probably take the shuttle.
77.32	6.41	And then, uh, work is on my mind, things to get done.
84.9	9.24	I'm a little concerned with how we're gonna, um, email and talk to Izumi and Lugal.
94.55	12.75	Uh, I think that conversation is giving me a little bit of anxiety probably just 'cause I'm not really sure how that'll go, but at the same time it's kind of exciting.
107.31	4.2	So I think I'm... I think I'm looking forward to that.
112.88	15.45	Uh, thinking about the rest of my week, Wednesday, I have to remember to bring the frozen stuff that I got from Trader Joe's to, uh, to the office.
128.95	9.78	Trying to save some money on these lunches, it's really, like, eating away at too much, uh, too much money.
139.01	8.82	Um, Thursday, uh, I'm trying to remember if something happens on Thursday.
148.87	7.3	Oh yeah, I remember Thursday we have a, a seminar and there's another person.
157.14	10.68	The person giving the talk is also named Phillip, and their, uh, their name is actually spelled like mine
168.1	3.79	I saw it in this morning's email, the seminar announcement.
172.51	13.72	Um, they spelled their name P-H-I-L-L-I-P which is really, really rare, or at least I never see, so it was kind of, like, exciting to see that there's another Phillip.
186.57	7.93	Uh, I actually meant to tell Natalia about that 'cause I was excited, but, um, that was kind of cool.
195.26	7.79	Uh, and then, oh, Iron Age is on, on Thursday too.
204.7	1.86	It's been so long since I've been there.
207.05	3.86	One of the places I have not been to since before COVID.
212.15	2.75	So I'm really excited to go back there.
215.15	1.95	Maybe I'll go to H Mart afterwards.
217.87	1.78	So Thursday should be a good day.
219.78	2.78	And H Mart, I have to remember to buy snacks.
223.51	4.41	Uh, all that little Pocky sticks and stuff like that, I have to remember.
228.11	3.07	I'll, I'll have to write that down later.
232.18	6.36	Um, let's see, uh, so I have a plan for Thanksgiving too.
240.0	7.77	Uh, I still don't know if I'll go up to Hennings, but I think that's kind of probably passed by now.
249.05	11.41	Unless I go up there for, like, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then go to Alpies and Crampies on Saturday.
261.69	7.4	And then I don't really have to be back by Monday so maybe I... Maybe I could still make it work.
269.1	1.23	It would be really nice.
271.47	4.23	I also really have to go to visit Sean and Dave.
276.97	12.69	Maybe I just do that like first or second week of December, or I do it before my flight home. I don't know.
289.93	5.01	Maybe I'll... Maybe I'll do it like the 18th or something like that.
295.07	0.73	I think that could work.
297.35	10.64	Just have to... I have to proctor on the 16th, but I think otherwise, uh, 18th... So 18th... 18th I think should be okay.
308.4	4.68	18th and stay until the 24th. I think that should be okay.
314.9	27.93	Uh, then, uh, I'm kind of staring at this, uh, big N thing, and I'm kind of going back to like where I am right now and this is how, how sort of weird this is, like looking at the cursor and it really does feel kind of like some sort of a weird dream.
343.92	8.55	Uh, feels weird to think that the monitor is not actually above me, but I've really been looking at it as, as if it is.
353.97	5.18	Um, I see click to add notes at the bottom of the, the PowerPoint.
360.88	4.23	See the little, uh, text blinking, text cursor thing.
367.34	5.09	And I feel my breathing, my breathing is more relaxed again.
373.52	5.51	Um, I remember, I really have to, to call Ace again.
379.16	4.96	He, I think he really would have been excited to actually do something like this himself.
385.35	9.05	But, he... I really hope he's, uh, gonna, gonna do well, find that job that he's still trying to get.
394.99	4.68	Uh, so good that, um, ____ is at scale now.
399.95	6.59	That was just so ironic that, uh, that he's there now.
406.86	2.09	I hope I... I hope I can see him in New York too.
409.5	2.36	I think he's s-... Well, I know that he's still there.
412.95	3.69	I thought he was... I always thought he was gonna end up in SF, now that I think about it.
416.87	5.77	But I'm really happy that he's... That he's still gonna be in New York.
423.32	3.87	It's such a shame that, like, I didn't become better friends with him almost.
427.51	6.91	Feels like I became better friends with him after I left, or like we, we talked more after I left.
434.65	6.82	We could've like... I feel like we could have really, like, gotten along super well, but we just, like, didn't cross paths a lot in Florida.
443.06	3.64	Kinda sad. Oh well, we'll, we'll make the most of it.
448.02	0.82	I'm sure I'll see him later.
451.25	3.36	Uh, oh, now I'm looking at the plus, I guess.
454.7	3.01	Oh yeah, I think the plus was supposed to be there instead of the big N.
457.84	1.41	The big N was good too.
463.94	5.73	Oh, I see, I see MATLAB on the, on the computer you know that just caught my eye.
470.44	2.82	I'm really not a big MATLAB fan anymore.
473.49	3.77	I'm so, I'm so happy that I switched to Python instead of MATLAB.
480.67	6.6	I'm thinking yesterday with the Google thing that I submitted, maybe I should have emphasized my, my Python stuff more, huh?
493.18	16.37	I really should have... I should have at least written in the cover letter, that would be like emphasizing that I actually taught Python stuff because you know I'd hoped that I'm not really gonna be, like, coding much.
509.69	9.28	I'm sure that coding is probably still a pretty big part of whatever they think I would be a good fit for.
518.98	6.44	So I really should have... I probably should have put more of that in there.
526.38	2.23	Oh, that's okay, I'll be fine.
529.02	5.77	But then, I think, I think I did a better job for the McKinsey one.
536.34	6.28	I, I doubt they really care about coding, but they... They... I don't know.
543.62	1.54	I still have to reach out to Shu.
546.07	6.64	It's like 50-50 about whether I should, uh, talk to him just 'cause it's busy at the moment.
552.98	19.92	But it would be really nice to just get like a feel for or try to get a feel for like, how, uh, how, like, mathematical I guess his work is and if, and if he knows any people who actually do like operations research-based stuff.
574.45	1.68	It's something that I would really like to do.
576.63	7.28	It just has to be the right, really in detail, the right type of job.
584.37	9.0	Not like something where I'm just telling people something about I think is good kind of consulting.
594.46	9.1	Consulting where I'm actually, ideally, actually building models for optimal, ____ optimization models and so on.
