3.92	5.4	So, I have no idea what to talk about at first because I just began and it feels very abrupt.
9.93	3.34	Um and it’s really funny to think that there’s people listening to it right now.
13.28	6.36	And it’s also very meta to talk about what you’re thinking about while you’re thinking about what you’re thinking about.
20.34	6.46	Uh which is similar to what I was talking to about the first time in the practice where I did the three minute one with Savannah.
27.44	5.69	Um and I’m also trying not to be too expressive with my facial features in case I move my head back.
37.39	2.96	I just crossed my legs uh subconsciously.
41.16	6.76	Um and I can feel that half of my body is exposed to the outside but then the other half is actually in here.
48.63	11.29	Um and I’m slightly tilted I think so I have one of my elbows hanging off but the other one is on whatever comfy thing I’m on but it I’m still comfortable so it doesn’t really matter.
60.63	4.35	Um and I do feel very secure like it’s pretty easy not to move my head which is nice.
67.48	4.05	I just thought so earlier today I was I was doing LSAT practice
71.7	3.17	and now I’m trying to think about how I don’t need to justify my thoughts.
74.99	2.48	I don’t need to explain them it’s not like I have an audience.
77.98	16.46	But I was doing LSAT practice and I was doing a couple of pro – problems and it was nice to actually get to do it for a long time because in the past couple of days I’ve been trying to do it but I finally got time to do it for like two hours in a row so that was good and I’m gonna do one more when we get when I get home.
95.45	6.93	Um and now I’m thinking about how long this will last and I feel like because we got here pretty early um it won’t be that long.
102.57	5.95	But ten minutes now feels so long because I have to talk the whole time and I’m already running out of things to talk about.
109.46	7.0	Um I also for for dinner last night I had tomato soup that I made myself that I was really excited to make.
116.54	7.46	Even though I don’t like tomatoes I decided I was going to make this tomato soup uh because I’ve had tomato soup before that I liked.
124.61	4.07	But ok so I was doing this and I like bought the tomatoes it was good.
129.33	8.5	Then I roasted them and blended it all and I ended up hating it which was unfortunate but at least uh my friend liked it.
138.69	18.81	Uh and now I’m thinking about how there’s construction workers outside of my window uh like directly outside of my window and so then I can’t go to the bathroom and so I had to use my roommate’s bathroom and she was at CVS so it was convenient because I didn’t have to interact with someone I could just like go use the bathroom like a normal person.
158.34	4.29	Uh and now I’m thinking about my entryway and how we just got rid of our rug because it was dirty
162.75	6.68	but I was thinking I’m we still have the rug I haven’t thrown it out yet so I might take it from my room and just clean it but I don’t know if it’s gonna go with my room.
170.41	1.19	Uh so probably not.
171.62	2.42	Honestly I don’t want to go through the effort so I’m not going to.
174.89	2.61	Uh but I do need to buy a rug for my room.
177.51	6.41	I just bought this new mirror that I actually was talking about last time I did this practice so it’s funny that we’ve gotten back to the mirror.
184.71	2.99	Uh but I bought this mirror and it came and I really like it it looks good
187.76	5.38	but I need to get a like uh a table a little table for the room.
193.97	7.89	Um and now I’m thinking about how I can look all around me but I’m supposed to look at this um thing to orient myself the cross on the screen to orient myself.
202.65	2.0	Which is nice cos it keeps me from moving around.
205.59	3.14	Um now I’m thinking about how I actually want a puppy.
209.96	11.91	Um I really really want a puppy to play with um but I don’t want the responsibility of having a puppy so I’m not getting a puppy but I consistently want a puppy that’s always in the back of my head that I want one.
222.19	1.48	Or a kitten but really a puppy.
223.75	2.66	I’m normally a dog person but I’ve had cats my whole life.
226.79	1.26	I just like animals in general.
228.06	0.95	I don’t like birds.
229.51	3.42	I’ve also had birds my whole life and they’re cute but they’re disasters.
232.95	7.1	And my sister has birds and she we just went on this trip and she didn’t get anyone to take care of the birds.
240.07	14.73	My mother didn’t let her take get anyone to take care of the birds which I think is ridiculous and so now I’m thinking about how when she came back from this trip their water was all gross and that was nasty and I just don’t want birds because they’re a disaster and they throw seed everywhere.
255.74	5.81	And now I’m thinking about Marblehead which is where I’m from and that was a justification which I don’t need to explain my thoughts.
262.39	8.31	Um and I just moved a little too so I’m trying not to move and now I’m very conscious of what I’m doing again cos I lost my train of thought
271.22	20.11	but then I just thought of Marblehead and I was gonna I was thinking about this wharf down by the harbor um with the boats and I and now I’m just picturing it in my head with like the Little League parking lot and then the ice cream store that’s right there and then up the street is Crocker Park where my friends and I like to go hang out.
291.76	5.02	I’d jump off the dock that they’d just put in and this dock hasn’t been in there for two years because of COVID.
296.87	2.18	So I’m happy that it’s actually in now.
299.55	3.73	Now I’m thinking how crazy it’s been how long COVID has been a thing.
303.37	7.21	It’s been like it’s also uh it’s also crazy that two years ago I was just starting college.
310.59	1.35	I was just about to start college.
312.83	5.53	Um and now I feel like it hasn’t been two years but also it’s been like forty years so I don’t know.
318.45	1.57	Time is weird college is weird.
321.12	11.24	Um the FFC just popped into my head and I’m thinking about how I want to convince my students from my FYM group to give me swipes to go into the FFC because I haven’t been there in so long.
332.79	5.7	Not because I want to eat there but because I wanna eat there for like the sake of eating there.
338.55	4.29	I don’t want to try the food but I wanna be like wow I’m standing in the FFC again after so long.
343.79	15.82	Um now I’m thinking about how my mouth is getting dry because I’m talking a lot and how maybe I should slow down what I’m saying because I don’t have that much to talk about and so if I go slower hopefully I have more to time more stuff to fill the time.
360.37	13.55	I’m also thinking about how it’s harder to talk when you can’t I can hear myself talking but I can’t hear myself talking as much so I feel kind of like out of body experience where I’m talking but my brain kinda feels disconnected that’s weird.
374.29	3.18	So it’s even harder to talk like that which is interesting.
380.5	8.49	Oh I’m gonna think about how I’m gonna meet up with my boyfriend after this because he’s also on campus here doing research.
389.41	5.9	Um and I might be able to see I I’ve never seen where his lab actually is so I’ll see that and now I’m thinking about what I’m gonna have for lunch too.
396.01	3.62	So I’m thinking maybe I’ll go out for lunch because I haven’t done that in a long time.
399.68	7.11	And I I was proud of myself yesterday because I actually cooked every single one of my meals which is something that I rarely do.
406.92	12.11	I I rarely cook meals but I also rarely cook three per day so I had like three concrete meals that people would consider like oh that’s uh like a meal that you cooked for yourself that I was proud of.
419.13	7.62	So I had oatmeal in the morning which I also just had to this morning and then what did I have for lunch I don’t remember.
426.79	22.43	Oh I had quinoa and spinach and I fried two eggs to put on top of it and I underdid the eggs a little bit which actually which repulses me so they were a little bit slimy which is nasty but I was able to get some of the slime away and then I just ate the rest and they weren’t that underdone so it was doable.
449.73	2.89	But I had that on top of quinoa and it was alright.
453.31	2.4	Um and then uh the tomato soup that I already talked about.
455.74	7.75	So like overall yes I made myself food but did I enjoy the food no so maybe I need to treat myself to eating out.
463.98	6.94	I’m getting better at cooking like the more I do it the better I get obviously but I don’t do it a lot so not that good.
471.98	2.6	Uh my roommates are really good at cooking.
474.82	1.69	I’m like learning from them.
476.67	7.57	It’s nice to live with people who like put a lot of time and effort into the making food because then I kinda uh it rubs off on me a little.
485.0	8.17	Uh but then I also like sometimes feel pressured to like be doing like be making cool food all the time because they are but I honestly I don’t care I’m not like that.
494.36	3.06	Um I watched Succession with them last night which is this new show.
497.85	1.39	It’s not new it’s new to me.
499.9	3.1	Um but I’m excited to continue watching this.
503.18	6.79	I started like on episode six because that’s where they were and I just joined in because I’d been gone for a week and it was so good.
510.93	1.26	So like there’s this guy.
512.68	4.94	There’s this whole family and they rule they don’t rule they own a company and it’s like Disney.
518.63	0.34	It’s like uh it’s like Bloomberg.
518.98	3.88	It’s an entertainment company and they like have theme parks and they all do all this stuff.
523.62	5.75	Um and it’s this whole family like in mind to inherit like board seats on this company.
530.39	3.63	Um and now I’m just thinking I just moved a little bit but that’s okay.
534.07	16.83	But in the show it’s really funny it’s like comedy drama uh but it’s hilarious and uh one of the brothers’ name is Kendall um and then Logan is like the father and I’m really bad with names so that’s like pretty much the only names I remember but there’s a lot of people in this family.
551.43	3.98	I think Siv or like Sif is the woman’s name and I really like her.
555.43	6.9	She’s like she works in DC and she’s like some sort of political like campaign manager.
563.39	8.97	Um which I would never want to do because I’ve worked at a campaign and it was awful and like I wanna stay far far away from that kind of like just campaigns in general they’re not fun.
573.3	12.49	Um but yeah the show and like the main part is that the characters are really well developed like they’re hilarious and I haven’t even watched that many episodes yet and already I’m like so invested in these characters.
586.39	8.83	Um and like as each episode goes on they get like more and more messed up and you’ll see like more inch of this family and I think it’s just such a cool show.
596.01	2.74	Um that’s just interesting to watch.
598.81	2.68	And now I’m thinking about how dry my mouth is.
