8.1	3.81	So that sound is pretty annoying.
13.64	3.62	Pretty fucking annoying actually but.
19.23	3.71	Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned today so that’s pretty good news.
23.12	4.52	It’s also pretty hilarious news because there’s so many scripts you could run.
28.11	3.71	So many skits you could run off of from just his speech alone.
33.17	0.28	And he.
35.25	3.04	His office did not look out for him at all.
39.25	9.7	Because how are you going to let a man who’s accused of harassing many many women say in the speech denying those accusations that he hugs everyone like that.
49.94	1.26	Just a bad look all around.
53.33	2.28	It’s going to be a very awkward dinner for them tonight.
56.66	2.49	Him and his brother who’s on vacation.
61.98	1.13	Hope mary’s doing ok.
63.27	3.8	I hope she’s asleep and sound and not throwing a temper tantrum.
69.59	0.81	She’s probably fine.
75.19	6.07	After this, I have to continue working on some data analysis.
83.55	5.33	I don't know why * is so obsessed with looking at the circularity of these aggregates.
89.64	1.27	They’re just like.
91.22	19.69	It’s fluorescence microscopy like it’s just too noisy for you to even make a real smooth outline of each aggregate which just doesn’t make sense like why the the signal to noise ratio is just too awful for you to say anything meaningful regarding the circularity of the aggregates.
111.88	0.9	Like ruggedness?
112.9	2.95	I don't know it’s it’s pseudoscience.
126.39	1.53	Ooh I am going to cook tomorrow.
129.0	1.08	I’m going to cook *.
131.77	1.42	uh that should be pretty good.
133.94	1.69	It should be pretty easy to make them too.
136.4	2.2	And that way I can clean everything up and pack up the kitchen.
141.3	6.38	And then I still have to decide if I want to sell all that stuff or move some of it.
150.07	3.27	Cause I could use an upgrade on an air fryer so I could just sell the one I have.
153.74	1.28	It’s kinda bulky.
157.32	1.54	I could also probably sell my rice cooker.
159.0	2.18	Cause I haven’t use that in like months.
163.51	3.93	Man ever since I learned white rice is apparently not that nutritious.
167.64	2.43	It’s just empty carbs.
177.71	1.43	That noise is still pretty annoying.
180.77	0.93	Even with the earplugs in.
186.56	4.27	Not even on a particularly good beat so I can’t even cipher on it.
198.22	1.96	* on my beat keep my * complete.
209.82	2.34	This projector has a weird left edge.
213.04	1.59	It’s like this really blue line.
216.3	1.89	It’s just like there’s something blocking it.
225.01	7.63	I should probably buy a mattress pretty soon cause it’s definitely not going to get there in time.
233.71	2.88	Gonna have to sleep a couple nights on the hardwood floor.
236.62	5.03	But if that’s what camping prepares you for.
250.73	1.36	Ooh that’s a good idea actually.
252.76	9.72	I could just ask my parents to mail my sleeping bag and single tent and that way you know at least it’s not the hardwood floor.
269.73	2.3	Ten minutes is a really long time.
276.49	2.1	But I’m sure it’ll be pretty short when it’s over.
281.98	4.63	I wish I knew how fMRI worked.
287.47	3.67	Cause I wish I could say something and tell it gently about whether it’s phrenology or not.
294.27	2.54	Cause in the one hand it’s pretty indirect.
298.37	5.85	Like if I was fasted, wouldn’t that scan just objectively look different than if I had just eaten?
307.31	1.55	Independently of any stimulus.
309.25	4.21	It would be a weird thing to ask someone before coming into the room too.
313.56	2.46	Like don't make make sure you don't eat.
316.03	6.13	You should’ve * the Scooby snacks I ate before I came in.
323.79	1.33	Three blues in a pack.
325.39	0.91	You know how rare that is?
326.43	1.42	I just ate all of them in one bite.
329.23	2.47	Really just disrespectful to Scooby Doo himself.
343.19	1.41	One last puppy class today.
345.21	8.36	Getting really annoying to move that crate again to the car and back but at least it’s the last time.
355.78	8.36	And then afterwards I can just buy a bunch of chick-fil-a.
367.84	2.73	Even though I say a bunch it’s going to be just my normal order.
371.96	10.67	Normal chick-fil-a sandwich meal with lemonade, fries, chick-fil-a sauce, and then 12 piece nuggs inside.
388.52	8.71	And honestly, I see the point of view about boycotting chick-fil-a because it’s bad for gay people but at the same time it’s just a corporation.
398.11	6.42	It’s not like they’re actively responsible for all homophobia which may sound like a rationalization to my actions.
404.94	5.11	But at the same time, if a terrorist invented the toothbrush, I wouldn’t stop using a toothbrush.
410.14	0.74	Makes no sense.
414.02	1.9	There are more meaningful ways to make a change.
417.62	5.34	Like for instance they changed the Aunt Jemima figure to avoid racism.
423.28	0.67	It’s like why?
424.92	2.22	It’s going too hard in the other direction.
431.33	6.99	Though what’s cool is I may have a collector’s item cause I have several models of Aunt Jemima’s.
440.13	1.19	And maple syrup lasts.
441.78	0.89	Pretty sure it’s like honey.
444.21	0.96	It’s just infinite shelf life.
447.17	1.24	Things just get trapped in there.
450.39	1.29	Crazy high Reynolds number.
467.82	5.8	I need to figure out how to randomly sample viewpoints if you’re rotating about an object.
474.35	4.15	Like if you’re looking at a spherical object or an ellipsoid it really doesn’t matter.
478.61	1.52	Actually just an object to be general.
480.22	5.39	So you can rotate in two directions but you need to pick a random number between 0 and 1.
485.96	7.35	And so that number needs to translate perfectly to a unique coordinate system.
493.74	1.6	Like a unique 2D coordinates.
497.05	0.77	I don't know how to do that.
499.8	1.17	Is it just.
500.98	2.46	Do you just start like like an image.
504.96	0.83	A row and column.
506.74	1.91	First row first column is zero.
509.61	1.31	Last row last column is one.
512.18	1.63	There’s gotta be something biased about that.
514.17	0.74	It just doesn’t feel right.
519.77	0.83	Probably is fine.
524.44	0.5	Yeah it’s probably fine.
525.4	2.07	Maybe I’ll just try that see if it works.
531.14	0.56	That’ll be cool.
534.59	5.07	Cause I’ll develop a lot of strong intuition about 3D objects getting projected onto 2D objects.
541.94	10.65	And whether or not a circular 2D aggregate can be estimated to be you know spherical if you get enough measurements.
553.87	5.98	Cause that at it’s core that’s all that really matters cause if you’re randomly selecting viewangles then it’ll just average out if it’s a sphere.
560.91	4.38	If it’s an if it’s an ellipsoid I don't know what happens in that case.
567.27	1.5	Probably get something an intermediate.
569.96	1.47	All those measures of circularity.
574.38	1.14	Oh yeah I didn’t even think about that.
575.62	2.38	It’s not just the shape it’s the measure you’re using.
580.61	3.07	Cause the shapes might average out it’s the circularity as a whole hole.
584.12	2.53	Another thing cause it doesn’t describe the shape per say.
587.62	4.53	It’s just like a side effect of the shape basically.
592.63	5.69	Oh well that would be worth digging in to.
