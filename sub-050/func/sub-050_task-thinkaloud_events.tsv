1.71	2.9	I am very excited to be part of this study.
5.67	2.77	When I get back home, I have to go on the Jimmy
8.74	4.27	and then I have to study for my exam, which is at 6:00 PM.
14.02	6.33	I'm kinda nervous about it, but I think that my way of studying is making sense to me.
20.48	2.94	So hopefully, I return the information.
24.61	3.34	Uh, I leave tomorrow to go to Kentucky.
28.74	3.08	I'm excited to see my sister and my mom.
33.62	5.8	My flight, I have to check what time the flight leaves, probably going to be in the morning.
41.01	10.24	I'm sad because my roommate, Wendy, is going back to California, and she's graduating early, so I won't be able to see her until graduation May.
52.74	2.9	I hope she finds someone to sublet her apartment to.
58.02	7.82	Uh, I can't wait to finish, uh, college so I can graduate and hopefully start working soon.
67.77	6.99	Uh, my dad is gonna be coming back from Cuba so I'll be seeing him, uh, on the 22nd.
75.16	4.31	I hope we get along and I hope we have a good time at the Christmas party.
81.45	5.05	Hopefully, my cousin decides to cook so we can actually have good food.
88.92	6.16	I hope that I get to see her dog, Coco, and I get to take him on a walk around the neighborhood
97.47	3.23	which reminds me, I have to take out the trash in the apartment.
101.84	6.68	Now that roommate responsibilities are over for the semester, I still have to clean the floors and stuff.
110.72	9.23	I also have to clean up my room 'cause after finals week, it's not looking very clean but I'll do that after my exam at nine.
122.5	13.19	I was planning to go to the gym but it looks like the gym is gonna be closing at 10:00 or actually close at 6:00, so I won't be able to go to the gym today but I might be able to go to the Academy gym.
137.4	5.76	I am excited to continue working out and tracking my workout and seeing progress.
144.52	5.45	Uh, something that I really wanna do is better my running speed.
150.0	2.43	I wanna be able to run faster and for longer.
153.58	4.87	Just the other day, I saw my friend.
158.51	1.88	She ran a marathon back in Louisville
161.4	5.45	and I wanna be able to... Be able to run a marathon, umm, so I...
168.08	1.55	I wanna start training for that.
171.03	10.19	I used to do cross-country so I think I can handle it but it's definitely been a long time since then, and I've noticed that I've gone really slow.
183.6	8.41	I need to schedule an appointment with the pre-professional advising office
193.2	6.66	and that reminds me, I also have to start shadowing dentists, so I can put that on my track... Well, my resume.
200.39	1.71	I also need to update my resume.
203.6	6.32	I am... I'm looking forward for a spring break because we have plans of going to the beach
210.7	6.77	and the last time I went to the beach was when I went to Ocean City in July
218.55	14.64	but I feel like it'll be a different group this time so I look forward to going with Sarah and Deb, but I do need to, uh, update my US passport to be able to go
233.75	2.29	and hopefully, I don't have to take the DAT then.
236.56	8.27	Hopefully, I stick to a good study schedule, and I'm able to take the DAT, umm, the first week of classes.
247.9	2.66	I am a little scared to take the DAT.
250.59	1.45	I feel like it's such a big exam.
252.92	1.84	I need to start prepping for that.
254.8	6.95	I also need to start going to church.
262.32	14.39	I feel like I didn't go the last past two Sundays because of finals and exams, but hopefully, after this round of exams, I can have a more solid routine
276.83	4.26	start waking up early again and going to sleep at a better time.
282.28	11.03	I feel like my goal is to go to start sleep around like 11:00 to 12:00 midnight and then start waking up at 6:00 to 7:00.
294.94	11.07	I feel like when I go back home, I can go with... To my mom and her work, and I can hopefully even stay at the library and study for the DAT there.
309.13	4.66	Hopefully, I stick to the study schedule and we can make it.
314.8	2.07	I am excited to see my sister back at home.
317.75	3.42	She was just at the ER because of her kidney stones
321.25	3.49	so I hope that when I see her, I can take care of her.
325.93	4.21	I hope by then my uncle finds a new place to live.
330.98	18.24	I hope that he and his... His partner can move out of the house and find a new apartment so they can become more independent, and that way I can study in the living room more comfortably.
351.02	2.42	I'm excited to try my mom's lasagna again.
354.14	4.44	She makes the world's best lasagna and it's one of my favorite foods.
359.77	3.96	I wonder what I'm gonna eat for dinner today because I literally have nothing in the fridge.
364.25	9.02	Since I'm leaving tomorrow, I didn't go grocery shopping and I literally only have oatmeal left.
374.85	10.33	I... Maybe, I might go to Chipotle but I'm also on a budget so I'll see what happens.
386.72	5.8	I might get something like, uh... Or I can go to Potbelly.
392.69	3.21	They have sandwiches there, so I can try that.
397.7	1.76	On the bus day, I took the Jimmy.
400.56	14.2	I... Even though I was early, the bus driver decided to wait seven minutes before actually leaving so I was like a couple minutes late to the study but we made it so it's fine.
416.34	2.9	Umm, it's good being back at the med campus.
419.37	5.6	I haven't been here since like the early in the semester 'cause of research.
425.79	6.86	So yeah, hopefully, I get to be back here again.
434.1	3.08	I decided to go to the airport.
437.35	1.85	I love going to the airport and traveling
439.87	5.44	and trying out new fast... ike fast food or a milkshake while I wait for my flight tomorrow.
446.3	8.72	Umm, when I take the exam, I'm gonna see Lucille again, and hopefully, I can see how she's doing.
455.24	0.88	Hopefully, she's good.
456.69	1.15	And also see Kap.
459.29	1.84	I hope the exam is not too hard.
461.7	7.93	I hope he's nice about it and doesn't put really tricky questions or questions that require a lot of memorization.
471.99	13.12	I didn't realize how long 10 minutes is, it's a long time and I'm running out of things to say but it's a good habit to talk out loud
485.45	3.2	which reminds me, I need to start maybe journaling again.
489.79	9.01	I feel like it just helps get things out of your mind and be able to have more clarity in your thought process.
500.12	6.07	It's also really hard to talk without moving your head, so hopefully, I'm doing a decent job.
507.94	8.75	Umm, when I go back home, I wanna get a haircut because I feel like my hair doesn't have any style to it so it's about that time.
518.23	15.77	Uh, I really wanna change the color but I don't want to not like it afterwards so I'm still on the fence if I wanna change the color of my hair right now, especially because my hair just seems very brittle and just not very healthy.
534.08	9.03	So hopefully, the new shampoo my mom sent over works, and hopefully, I can get like a good schedule for washing my hair.
545.57	5.66	I feel like that will help, umm, with that.
551.41	3.26	I'm excited to see pictures of my brain scan, of my brain.
555.11	4.83	And I actually wrote a paper about fMRIs so it's actually kinda cool to be inside one.
561.79	28.57	I also need to start practicing for my interviews soon for like post grad, like application things so it'll help me if I become more comfortable speaking out loud because a lot of the time when I think, I think to myself, so having to get to voice my opinions and thoughts, uh, it would be good practice for then.
592.47	5.06	Uh, I was going through Instagram a lot lately.
597.57	5.71	I've been on Instagram a lot lately which is not good 'cause it's finals week so I should not be on Instagram but...
