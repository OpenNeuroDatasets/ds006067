-6.94	2.08	Is it currently starting right now?
0.99	1.71	Okay, I guess it's starting now.
3.24	5.55	First off, I am grateful to be part of this research study.
9.02	4.28	It's interesting because I currently coordinate several other studies at the moment.
13.8	6.42	But I've never been part of a study, so it was kind of interesting signing the consent form just now.
20.76	6.62	But anyways, I initially was worried about doing this study because I was worried I had undiagnosed claustrophobia.
27.38	7.6	But right now it seems to be going pretty fine at the moment, just because it really doesn't feel like I'm being suffocated, which I'm grateful for.
35.94	11.08	Right now, the noise around me is a little bit jarring, but it's manageable once I become a little bit conditioned to it.
47.24	13.68	But otherwise, I hope I can contribute good data to this research study, also help everyone, just hopefully turn this into translational results as well.
61.5	5.32	But otherwise, this week has been going pretty okay.
67.03	6.22	I wish I could catch up on a little bit more sleep, but otherwise I've been mostly just chilling.
73.25	2.17	Still trying to maintain a pretty good schedule.
75.6	2.27	Yesterday I caught up with a friend.
78.23	4.59	It was nice because he drove all the way up from Blacksburg, and then we got Ekiben.
83.16	5.19	And, of course, as Ekiben is, it is extremely exquisite and delicious.
89.21	6.83	But afterwards, I just went back home, and then one of my friends decided to play Overcooked with me.
96.24	10.16	And then we just continued playing for a little bit while, and I invited a few other friends, which I think made my Monday evening a little bit livelier than it normally is.
106.44	1.69	So that's pretty nice.
108.41	1.22	And then today we're right here.
110.17	7.89	Prospectively in the future, there are a few things I still want to do in general with my life.
118.24	15.26	But as a near future goal, I would really like to do a 5k run, and then also in addition to that, I just want to be able to start my dieting and start meeting a few of my fitness goals.
134.2	3.77	But in due time, that will hopefully happen soon.
138.42	3.5	And I can feel some movement going on right now, but that's okay.
142.24	3.32	I've actually kept quite snug here.
145.95	3.97	It feels almost like, not necessarily a warm hug, but I feel very stabilized.
149.92	5.74	Which I kind of wasn't expecting, so it was a pleasant surprise to feel like I am pretty stabilized at the moment.
156.8	5.56	But in the near future I would like to also travel a little bit more.
162.45	2.59	There's a few list of places I have in my mind.
165.44	4.0	I am planning on going to San Diego this summer, which is quite nice.
170.16	2.93	I just hope that I can save enough money beforehand.
173.09	6.13	But fortunately, I think I should be able to based on how I calculated all my spreadsheets.
179.98	4.36	But, yeah, this noise seems to be still a little bit jarring.
184.79	1.67	Not getting as conditioned as I thought.
186.84	4.48	But it's not too bad, because I kind of tend to ramble onwards and onwards.
192.8	8.2	But anyways, in the upcoming weeks, I hope to still be able to contribute a lot to my job.
201.62	6.94	And in addition, continue to still be a good friend and partner to people.
210.18	3.68	Yeah, it is going pretty well right now.
214.24	7.3	In the near future, today after work, I am planning on going to the gym, actually.
222.02	2.3	Hopefully, I can meet a few more fitness goals there.
225.2	2.7	But these days I've been a little bit burnt out going to the gym.
227.92	6.68	Only because when I go to the gym, I'm kind of low-key hungry, because I usually go right before dinner.
234.8	2.66	And that kind of sucks a little bit.
238.24	5.88	Just because I get really hungry, and preparing ingredients really takes a lot of freaking time.
245.38	4.98	So, I do like to keep my workouts a little bit short.
250.74	2.74	But I kind of want to also maximize the effectiveness of them.
253.88	2.7	So, it's a little bit tough consolidating with that.
257.6	3.96	But I also am glad that I'm still just maintaining my health at the moment.
261.68	4.3	I'm not sure if I'll have time to maintain my health in the near future.
268.94	2.92	So that's why I'm also focusing on my goals at the moment, like my fitness goals.
271.94	7.04	Just to be completely sure, and just making sure everything is in order.
279.88	8.34	Next Halloween, I am wearing a rather risque outfit that I'm not going to share, because this is publicly heard.
288.66	2.28	But I do need to look fit for that.
292.34	2.64	So that's partially why I'm doing my fitness goals at the moment.
295.24	7.63	But otherwise, I'm also just okay with where I'm at currently in my life.
302.87	2.87	Fitness goals, and also personal goals.
308.98	5.86	In a few hours after this, I also got to go give some rabbits some eye drops.
315.26	2.28	And that's kind of interesting, just because...
318.16	3.96	Well, not interesting, but more like relatively exhausting, actually.
322.24	6.8	That I have to go and give rabbits eye drops, even on the weekends.
329.12	6.84	Which is kind of a somewhat intensive process, and I wish I had a little bit more weekend time to myself.
336.6	4.2	But I think I'm going to submit overtime in this upcoming week, so that'll be hopefully good.
341.02	8.58	I'm also aware of the fact that suddenly, I think sometimes when I'm making comments, I tend to laugh and shake a little.
350.24	3.14	Personally, I apologize if that is a major problem.
353.44	6.86	But also, secondly, I'll try to refrain from being still while I'm in this thing.
360.46	4.1	So again, that way, y'all have good results to analyze.
367.25	2.41	I'm just having a good time right now.
369.92	1.32	Hopefully, I won't get too sleepy.
371.38	3.32	Lying down like this is exceedingly comfortable.
374.88	2.38	My head has never felt so snug before.
377.8	6.72	It just feels like I'm being, not necessarily massaged, but the warm feeling of having my ears covered.
384.74	1.22	It's really quite nice.
388.11	4.19	And then this slight movement of going back and forth in this MRI machine.
392.7	3.02	I wouldn't necessarily call it cradling, perhaps.
396.38	2.8	But it gives almost a slight hammock vibe.
399.98	4.5	Which suddenly brings me an image of Tennessee, I'm not going to lie.
406.46	2.0	Because we have a hammock in our backyard.
409.8	2.42	And I do enjoy sleeping in there during the summer.
412.74	1.84	So, I kind of miss a little bit of home right now.
414.8	2.44	But fortunately, I think during June I'll be back home.
417.64	4.76	And that'll be good again, because I can just see my family, see the dog.
422.88	4.34	And then I can spend the last few months relaxing before August comes up.
429.46	2.04	Otherwise, it's going pretty well.
434.06	2.64	Just wish I could catch up a little bit more sleep.
436.82	4.24	Honestly, that's the main short-term goal I have at the moment.
443.54	2.86	But once I do that, then it'll be good.
446.94	5.12	I've been having some rather odd dreams lately in my sleep.
453.2	3.18	There's the Gundam-style man, Sai.
456.4	2.84	He popped up in my dreams a few times recently.
459.28	2.7	I don't know why, I haven't listened to his music in a while.
463.3	1.72	So, I don't understand how he popped up.
465.02	3.02	But I think I dreamed of him as an uncle of some sort.
468.04	3.14	And he was somehow a family friend, which is quite interesting.
473.9	3.44	I think I struggle nowadays to remember my dreams.
477.38	1.98	I used to be very good at remembering my dreams.
480.84	5.32	Because I used to keep, not the dream diary, but I would usually vent to one of my friends about my dreams.
486.94	2.88	But that friend has no longer started responding to my messages.
489.96	2.58	Well, it's not like they don't respond to my messages.
492.74	5.3	But it takes them around three, not three months but one month to respond to my messages.
498.8	2.29	So, I don't really converse with them as much.
501.09	5.97	I think it's partially because they're now a really big Harry Styles fan girl.
508.3	2.96	So, they've been going to a lot of concerts very, very often.
511.78	3.34	Which is cool because she has the money and the resources to do so.
515.5	4.06	But I think she in turn has not talked to me.
519.64	1.8	And a lot of my other friends as well.
521.54	1.36	Which is a little bit disappointing.
523.66	2.18	But I feel like that's how friendships come and go.
528.22	6.04	I think otherwise right now, the noise is still going at me.
534.36	4.88	It sounds almost like, I wouldn't say like, I want to call it bullets.
539.34	1.68	But that seems a little bit too morbid.
541.24	5.7	I think I'd rather say it's more like a very persistent alarm clock.
548.02	3.96	Which is like mildly annoying, but not really.
552.6	1.38	Oh, speaking of annoying actually.
554.22	3.58	This morning I had to play the carrot card.
559.24	3.72	So, during late December, I placed an order for a bag.
563.5	1.66	And it was for my girlfriend.
565.44	2.02	And I wanted to give it to her for Valentine's Day.
567.66	2.4	But the order kept on getting delayed and delayed.
570.52	3.92	And now, I had to email their customer service.
574.6	2.92	And they said February 20th that they would ship it out.
578.4	0.96	Which is fine.
580.09	0.82	Sure, it's late.
581.45	1.23	But it's fine, you know.
583.2	2.84	But then, they were telling me about...
587.14	3.1	Well, then I didn't receive any confirmation yesterday.
591.08	2.5	And this morning I was a little bit pissed.
595.5	1.19	Because it's like a puffy bag.
596.69	3.15	So, it's very optimal to have it during the winter time.
599.9	1.66	And spring is coming up.
