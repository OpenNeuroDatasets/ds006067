3.94	2.88	What will I have for dinner tonight?
13.68	0.24	I have food in the fridge.
13.92	2.56	I have some food in the freezer also.
17.8	9.06	I need to make sure that I go to the grocery store tomorrow, or maybe on the way back from here
27.92	7.1	depending on the time I leave for the dinner tomorrow.
37.96	3.46	Thinking about what I should make for dinner with my friends.
43.3	1.54	Probably some kind of pasta.
45.04	7.09	I was thinking, well my friend is vegetarian
52.19	3.89	so I need to make sure there is no meat in it.
59.02	5.34	But I could do pasta with cheese because she is vegetarian.
65.6	1.31	I don't think she is vegan
67.04	3.2	but we will definitely confirm.
70.24	2.94	I'll text her later.
76.42	2.5	I will probably stop at the Italian market.
89.72	0.6	I think they close before 6 though, so I will probably have to go there tomorrow.
90.32	5.4	Tomorrow, maybe I will go into work early so I can prepare the dinner on time.
106.72	2.96	If I go to work at, maybe I'll by 7, get there by 8.
113.82	2.76	Then, let's see, what do I have to do tomorrow?
118.96	4.58	I have to do at least one round of PCRs.
124.16	3.68	Need to make sure I get the analysis done from the other round.
131.0	0.96	That's currently still running.
133.08	1.34	It's definitely done by now.
136.42	3.36	So, I'll be able to get the results tomorrow morning for that.
140.64	6.08	So, maybe I'll start one round of the PCRs.
156.14	0.24	Which samples should I do first?
161.36	2.34	I'll do last week's samples first.
165.08	2.54	Put those into the PCR machine.
167.94	5.64	I'll take about two hours.
177.66	4.12	While that's running, I can analyze the data from the PCR machine.
183.26	2.12	That's the results that are showing now.
187.52	10.46	That will take me probably until about, if I get there at 8, it will probably take me until maybe 9.
198.16	1.88	9.30pm?
201.28	4.14	And then I can go down to the flow room.
207.2	5.16	The reservation is at 10pm, so I'll have to be down there by 10pm.
215.04	4.68	I think the reservation is from 10 to 3.
219.96	3.22	Hopefully, it won't take that long.
224.46	11.44	Maybe if the reservation is from 10 to 3, and if Nazli and Parna can also come down with me, then hopefully it won't take that long.
240.08	4.7	Maybe we could switch, we could take breaks.
248.36	2.58	Especially because I will definitely want to eat lunch,
252.43	2.07	which I didn't have time to do last time.
260.16	13.5	Let's see, so if I'm down there from 10 to 3, and then I leave by 3.34, I could definitely make it home.
275.32	4.3	Maybe stop at Trader Joe's on the way for some of the ingredients.
282.36	1.08	Yeah, I'll do that.
283.44	13.64	I'll stop at Trader Joe's so things are cheaper, and then I'll stop at the Trader Joe's in Columbia, so it's on the way, so I save time.
301.72	14.18	And then I'll get back, stop at the Italian market, hopefully that will put me around 4:30pm maybe.
315.94	1.94	5:00?
318.36	11.3	And then I can walk down to the Italian market, grab something quick, maybe like bread or something, or like some fresh cheese.
331.7	6.99	Then I'll go back up to my apartment and maybe try to do a workout before everyone comes
338.77	1.11	and shower.
344.12	9.84	I think that they will probably be late, so I would assume that even though I said 7, they probably won't get there until like 7.30 or so.
355.02	5.78	And then I probably will have some wine,
361.02	8.86	so she might be doing Dry March.
370.42	7.02	So, maybe I should make a mocktail or something or get other drinks.
383.46	5.28	I could also just not have wine at all, so then she doesn't feel uncomfortable.
390.26	3.26	That might be the best move.
396.0	0.71	So, we'll eat.
397.11	7.55	And I'm thinking, wondering where everyone's going to sit.
407.28	4.54	I should probably order those two other chairs for my table on Amazon.
412.72	3.85	Not for tomorrow, but for the future.
416.59	5.53	It would be nice to have them in case I'm having more than two people at my place.
424.48	7.46	I should definitely order a cabinet that I was looking at since I moved my plant.
435.76	1.3	I need to water my plants.
437.06	6.04	Oh, and I need to replace the one plant that's on the right.
444.64	0.96	Yeah, since that one died.
449.12	2.34	What am I doing on Saturday?
452.16	2.84	I could maybe go Saturday morning to the plant store.
457.52	10.1	I should save my money, but I would rather buy plants.
473.84	9.3	And if everybody leaves by like 9.30, then I have to go watch the dogs.
484.44	10.12	So that will be around 10 to 10.30 is when I have to watch the dogs
494.61	6.31	and then come home and read.
502.24	6.44	Probably won't have enough time to do my Hopkins work.
510.16	3.66	I wonder if Doug ever got my email.
515.92	9.56	I was supposed to have a call with him later tonight, but I don't think he responded to the email.
530.24	7.7	Maybe I could talk to him tomorrow before everyone comes over for dinner, but we'll see.
539.14	6.44	I definitely will need to talk to him in the next two days because I have something due for him on the 22nd.
548.52	20.6	And yeah, if that's due on the 22nd then probably when I get home tonight I should send him my abstract just so that's done.
569.12	4.62	Also in case I need to send it to any of the other authors, which I probably will have to do.
581.54	7.2	Yeah, I'll definitely have to send that to other people, and I'm wondering too if...
592.52	2.07	Oh, Mary said she was going to send me hers,
594.66	2.66	but I don't really need to look at hers I guess.
597.58	2.98	I guess I could just let her know that I'm submitting.
