0.96	1.95	okay, low key, I really don't...
12.45	1.82	isn't that the sign to not speak?
15.33	2.23	wait, I'm, I'm really confused.
18.68	6.51	I, I really feel like I'm not supposed to be speaking right now, but I don't actually know if I'm supposed to.
25.53	2.87	okay, I'm just gonna talk because no one's stopping me.
28.92	1.39	okay, this is really awkward.
31.82	3.91	I really, I really hate that gray screen.
36.14	1.26	it's such an ugly color.
37.97	4.54	I just don't even, I think you should really bring back the the sand dunes.
42.9	1.33	I really like the sand dunes.
44.3	5.59	they remind me of when I went to Saudi Arabia and I didn't even get to, like, I didn't get to like stand on the dude.
49.91	1.34	oh my god, I just pressed the yes button.
51.35	1.32	that was not on purpose.
53.1	2.89	I don't know if you guys can hear me, but that was definitely not on purpose.
56.38	2.91	like I, I'm gonna take my thumbs off of them, actually, now.
59.34	2.56	because I also have really hot in here.
61.96	1.99	like, I should not have asked for that blanket.
63.98	1.0	that was a bad idea.
65.87	2.27	you know, I, I sleep every night.
68.54	2.09	I mean like I just have those blankets for decoration.
70.66	1.9	I should put them in like my suitcase or something.
72.94	5.74	I don't even know what I have those blankets for, because they're not even that, like, I guess they're they're too warm, actually.
79.02	2.42	so they're really good blankets, and I sleep.
82.3	5.09	oh my god, last night I was sleeping so good, and then this morning I woke up and it was so wack.
87.44	0.92	I every morning, I wake.
88.49	3.16	okay, the sound of the MRI scan is really distracting me.
91.66	2.14	I don't even know if I'm supposed to be speaking right now.
94.25	1.19	it's actually a really bad idea.
95.59	2.69	I really, I, I should have asked for the instructions.
98.56	5.73	I just don't, I know that the black button is the chain word chain game, whatever.
104.7	4.02	but isn't this cross the one that I'm supposed to not speak during?
109.24	12.67	like, I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to speak when I see the cross, and yet the scanner thing is going on, and then the lady, the whoever, the robot is was like, when you hear the over the next scan will last 10 minutes.
121.93	4.57	and I remember from the little PowerPoint, right there showed me is that, the the wherever.
126.56	1.64	I can't stop speaking in my mind.
128.61	9.87	that's supposed to last 10 minutes too, so I'm like okay, so that I feel like I should be speaking right now, but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't be speaking because of that cross.
138.98	5.61	I am really bothered by that cross, and now saying cross like 15 times made me think of Jesus for absolutely no reason.
144.63	4.88	I'm not even religious like that, but I'm thinking about Jesus now, which is really awkward.
149.55	2.16	and now I'm like picturing him in the middle of Rome.
152.25	2.0	which, I'm pretty sure, did he even go to Rome?
154.98	0.87	wait, I think he died.
155.87	4.38	In like the middle, well, okay the Middle East is definitely no, not the Middle East.
160.35	2.52	Rome is definitely in Italy, I know that for a fact.
163.26	5.28	in the middle is middle, mid, oh my god, the Middle East is obviously not in Italy.
168.97	2.36	okay, wait, what is the end for this scan?
171.73	1.02	like, what is the sign?
173.54	2.62	imagine they didn't want me speaking and I've been speaking the entire time.
176.21	1.03	that would be so awkward.
177.57	7.19	she's gonna hate me, the person who runs this- this thing- miss Li, I think that's her class.
184.79	2.78	okay, not okay, let me, let's go back to...
187.63	1.36	I'd rather talk about Jesus again.
189.19	2.9	honest to God, Jesus and being in the Middle East.
192.93	7.98	okay, also I just don't believe religion, like no way that stuff that happened, I think Mohammed the Prophet, he like discovered...
201.36	5.42	is or no, it was like, like God told him, like God gave him revelations.
206.86	1.87	wasn't it like 900 CE?
209.3	5.57	isn't that way after Jesus, cuz that CE is common era, so I know that was after Jesus.
215.72	2.35	his Jesus was zero common era, I guess.
218.75	7.5	So, if God has given you all these revelations, when he mentioned, oh, by the way, there's this guy named Jesus and he's my son.
226.59	3.26	oh wait, I guess Jesus was dead by now, cuz there's no way Jesus was...
230.66	1.14	I actually don't know how old Jesus...
232.48	1.05	did he ever die?
234.29	5.48	I don't think he could have died cuz he's like the Son of God, but at the same time, can the son...
240.47	1.34	I'm not religious enough actually.
242.14	7.42	and now, now I'm thinking about families in the south, like southern, like super, like plantation owners that sucks.
249.96	4.54	and I'm thinking about, oh my god, that movie Where the Crawdads Sing, I actually kind of liked it.
254.55	1.36	I don't know why Tanisha didn't like it.
255.95	1.27	I thought it was kind of fire.
257.25	2.34	I thought well, not kind of fire.
259.65	1.22	okay, actually, it was kind of..
261.6	2.02	I was, it was, it was fine.
263.72	5.7	it was not feel-good, but it wasn't like not not feel-good, like I felt good after.
269.47	2.37	I think I felt satisfied.
271.99	4.0	also I was really, I was like, wow, she's the one that killed him.
276.03	1.14	that was so crazy to me.
279.42	2.82	I can't, but well, why am I seeing my grandma now?
282.89	3.88	okay, I'm definitely not, like not like seeing her like a hallucination, not.
287.1	2.15	hey, is that, is the cross moving?
289.48	2.14	I would, I would swear that thing is moving.
292.36	1.52	maybe it's because I'm in this space.
294.37	0.76	I understand.
295.2	1.47	okay, now I'm actually getting kind of cold.
296.8	2.32	whoa, this machine is really cool.
299.69	0.88	I've never been in it.
300.94	0.51	no, it's a lie.
301.48	5.45	I have been an MRI before, except that there wasn't these headphones in this like speaker thing up on my mouth.
307.49	9.11	it's like scratching that part of my face that's between my mouth and my nose, and part of me really wants to like move it.
317.61	0.94	actually, it's all of me.
318.58	4.0	All of me really wants to move it, but I can't because I can't mess up the scans.
323.55	2.14	and this makes me think of Grey's Anatomy.
325.79	4.73	oh my god, in the tenth season they got that cool machine- actually I don't know, it was the tenth season.
330.54	4.97	it was probably, it's probably after the tenth season cuz 11th season was when Derek died.
335.96	1.84	I don't think that that cool machine when he was there.
338.15	1.09	I hated his character.
339.27	1.24	he literally hated women.
340.56	1.12	we could all tell.
342.0	1.6	he literally sucked.
344.45	1.41	the worst character ever.
346.6	1.47	no, he barely had development.
348.3	2.26	he's, he's like, he's like a cheater.
350.63	4.15	he cheated on his wife, and they got had the balls to be mad at Meredith for that.
355.1	5.86	she should have been with the cute vet, and I will always, always say that she should have gone with the veterinarian.
360.99	1.7	actually, I just don't even like Meredith like that.
363.11	11.97	she's a very good doctor, and she is she's got proper ethics later in life, but I did not like Meredith for most of her life and I don't like how standoffish she is but I get it.
376.39	6.01	I feel like her and I just aren't a good match for each other, but she's also fictional characters, who actually cares?
382.84	3.07	oh my god, imagine she tells me I should have not been speaking the entire time.
386.41	4.61	I don't even know what I would have to tell her, that I did speak and then I would be super embarrassed, and then I'd have to leave.
391.37	2.16	also I don't like that they made me take my purse off.
393.63	0.7	that is mine.
395.22	4.29	I know we're like, I know everyone here believes in science because we're like in a hospital.
399.88	3.44	I'm literally in a medical study or research study.
403.76	1.2	whoa, I can hear my echo.
405.56	3.73	I actually I think I've been aware of it the entire time, but now I can like really hear it.
409.77	1.76	but I'm actually not sure if that's my echo or not.
411.57	1.06	I wonder if they can hear me.
413.03	5.2	if you guys can hear me actually don't say anything, or I guess it I guess you guys wouldn't, even if you could.
418.86	4.69	no that'd be so awkward if they were like afterwards, they were like yeah we can hear the entire time.
423.64	1.43	that would be so awkward.
425.6	2.93	Were there like rules to what I couldn't say while I was in here?
429.18	0.97	I don't even know.
430.24	2.78	wait, I'm really scared that they're gonna put that black ball there and we're gonna,
433.06	5.2	word, word game, word chain game, but what is it word chain game?
438.68	0.45	chain word?
439.17	1.09	it's definitely word chain game.
440.29	1.76	okay, I'm definitely right on that one.
442.41	2.14	I just got chills, that was so cool.
444.76	1.8	and I'm thinking about that movie, Brother Bear.
446.61	2.77	oh my god, I recently rewatched it, and it was actually really good.
449.68	4.69	but I felt a little bit, oh, like underwhelming.
454.53	5.77	I feel like it was better when I was a kid, but it was obviously better than I was when I was a kid, because I was a kid and it's a kid's movie.
460.41	1.01	like obviously it was better.
461.78	0.67	this is what I want.
462.48	2.08	I rewatched Good Luck Charlie and it was so bad.
464.59	3.08	I was like, I can't believe I I watched this for entertainment.
467.72	3.08	thought it was really good and it was really good when I was a child.
470.84	2.38	but like it's obviously not the best plot ever.
473.66	1.79	I really want to watch a Netflix show now.
475.49	1.13	like, I know I'm all amped up.
476.72	2.9	this morning I was all like in my reading era.
479.68	3.88	I mean I've always been in my reading era, but I was just like reading, not doing anything.
483.62	3.87	and now I'm all amped up because of this and the what is it called?
487.57	2.2	and not anatomical scans.
490.21	1.18	okay that's actually irrelevant.
491.74	4.83	the point is that they're they're allowing me to just talk, and when I just talk...
496.68	4.81	oh my god, I have to do my transport homework, but it doesn't look that long because I looked at it already.
501.89	1.22	I think it's gonna be fine.
503.71	5.35	what I'm really annoyed about is I just procrastinate so much during the week and then push.
509.1	1.84	oh my god, my Islam class.
511.05	1.59	dude, I have some readings to do.
512.71	1.38	oh my god, no way.
514.13	1.88	I have, when is the paper?
516.34	1.85	I shouldn't have skipped class on Thursday.
518.56	1.78	I really shouldn't have because now I don't know.
520.38	5.72	and also Mia never sent me her notes and I was like, hey no pressure, but like could you send me your notes?
526.13	2.94	and she literally was like, pressure-free, and then didn't reply.
529.11	3.5	I was like, okay so you're not precious on them, so you won't send them or what?
533.5	1.49	but I would have sent you my notes.
536.05	0.82	it's just notes.
539.72	1.04	I'm kind of annoyed about that.
540.84	6.65	also a lot of me, because my throat low-key, like I really I want to gulp them down, but I have to keep speaking so I'm not gonna do that.
548.66	13.26	I wonder if this is the type of scan where they can see, like my brain, not my like, yeah my brain as like things are happening, because that's how they discovered Amelia's a brain tumor in Grey's Anatomy in season, whatever.
562.48	5.73	okay, I actually I'm pretty sure, actually, I have no idea what season it was.
568.58	0.76	I really don't know.
569.36	1.61	I don't know as good as like, new girl.
571.0	3.78	like, give me a new girl season and I'll tell you literally when it was.
574.83	4.77	um, like, which like tell me, no give me an episode, I'll tell you which season it was.
580.13	5.99	but obviously don't give me like the title, because you give me a title, it's called something like girls night.
587.18	3.33	well actually, I think a girl fight.
590.77	2.99	yeah yeah okay, oh actually, actually I should, maybe I can.
593.78	1.9	girl fight was season four, I'm pretty sure.
596.0	4.58	because it was after Nick and Jess were broken up, but it was when coach...
