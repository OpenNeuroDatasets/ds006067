1.14	1.73	I feel like I'm an idiot for not...
3.86	2.71	for thinking that volume was the machine.
7.19	0.93	I'm starting too early.
8.12	0.87	That was the one thing that...
9.47	0.36	All right, we're good.
10.35	4.1	Um, but, I guess in terms of a different topic, I have to pick up grad school pretty soon.
14.91	0.78	It's kind of stressful.
17.65	5.32	But, it's weird because I guess you're deciding the next six years of your life, but then you're not getting paid as much as people around you.
23.13	1.4	But at least you don't have to pay for school.
24.93	1.76	Like if you go to med school, you have to pay for school.
26.75	0.62	That kind of sucks.
28.37	2.3	I see also the advantage of no residency.
31.19	1.38	Residency is kind of brutal.
33.63	7.38	I know I see postdocs are pretty hard, but like, postdocs are a lot easier than doing residency work 90 plus hours a week.
45.07	1.92	I'm pretty glad I made the switch out of pre-med.
48.19	1.64	I think most people in school come in pre-med.
50.87	1.1	They'll stick with pre-med.
52.59	3.02	And they get miserable because they try to become a doctor.
58.71	1.72	Except that you weren't a doctor, it's pretty good.
61.51	1.28	I guess classes are going okay.
63.39	0.98	It's my last semester.
64.53	2.06	It's kind of dumb that I took so many classes.
67.85	1.3	Didn't get a chance to take a break.
70.23	1.22	And like, that was pretty stupid.
71.85	1.06	I don't know why I did that.
74.47	1.18	But classes are going okay.
76.77	1.9	I guess, I don't know what else to talk about.
79.27	2.08	My homework is pretty hard.
82.17	2.3	Maybe it's also because I work a lot less.
84.97	1.18	I'm almost done.
88.23	0.62	That's kind of bad, butâ€¦
91.85	1.66	I guess research also takes a long time.
95.37	1.72	Also, reading less papers is pretty bad.
98.65	0.44	But I guess it's good to...
99.87	2.14	I'll get some second author and first author publications.
102.93	0.56	Which is nice.
104.31	3.48	It's always a good look for grad school, PhD programs.
109.15	1.1	But beyond that, I don't know.
111.51	1.06	Social life is fine.
113.47	1.12	I'm just gonna miss Hopkins
114.75	0.9	I'm going to leave.
116.05	1.26	It's kind of sad.
117.63	1.08	It's a different topic.
120.57	1.48	I'm watching the World Baseball Classic.
122.87	3.48	It's USA vs Japan in the last stage.
127.41	1.14	The US will probably win.
129.31	1.16	Japan is pretty good.
130.81	3.44	I would say Shohei Otani is pretty good at baseball.
135.85	0.66	I'm a little bit sad.
137.99	4.2	The countries I thought would do well, like the Dominican Republic and South Korea, are pretty horrible.
143.07	1.3	They lost in the group stage.
144.39	2.2	I'm a big fan of baseball.
147.07	2.38	I think baseball will do well in the grand stage.
149.61	1.34	It's pretty good.
151.87	1.1	This is actually pretty hard.
153.99	5.36	Thinking about thinking and verbalizing your thoughts is really hard after you get past two minutes.
159.83	1.34	Maybe other people have said this too.
161.77	3.24	I'm kind of scrounging my brain for what to talk about.
165.41	1.66	I'm also trying to make sure to keep still.
167.51	1.28	I hope I'm keeping still.
169.13	1.68	I'm kind of moving my jaw, not my face.
173.35	1.84	I'm pretty excited to make money.
175.63	1.14	I bought myself a new air fryer.
178.59	5.02	Before I actually made the money, I bought myself an air fryer with the research money.
184.35	1.0	I guess I'll make some stuff.
186.74	1.35	I don't know, air fryers are really cool.
188.25	3.46	It's like an oven, but it's less time and better convection.
192.49	2.3	Air fryers are pretty nice.
202.63	1.28	I've never broken a bone.
204.49	1.12	I guess this is a story.
207.37	2.88	I'm trying to make it as a different topic as possible.
211.13	1.44	Actually, I did break my bone once.
213.99	0.92	One time I ran into a wall.
215.55	1.9	But that was intentional, so I don't know why I did that.
217.71	3.16	When I was seven years old, I fractured my ankle.
221.45	2.3	I think that's one of the reasons I'm pretty short now.
225.93	0.84	I guess now I'm pretty short.
227.27	2.55	Not really that short, but shorter than average.
229.82	2.57	I think I fractured my ankle when I was seven and still growing.
233.69	2.4	I think that's the reason why I'm not 5'10 or 5'11.
236.55	1.96	I'm just a small 5'7.
239.69	5.54	I guess the cross in the middle of the screen keeps looking like it's moving, but it's not actually moving, which isn't really keeping any.
245.65	4.4	I know it's probably some psychological effect, where if you look at an object for a long time, it starts to move.
251.55	4.9	But yeah, I've been trying to focus my gaze on the cross so I don't move my face or mouth.
257.13	1.41	I hope I'm doing a good job at that.
258.54	1.95	I really hope I haven't moved my head around.
263.89	1.2	I guess I'd like to research, say, ophthalmology.
265.79	2.3	I don't know why I picked ophthalmology.
268.71	1.4	Eyes are kind of freaky.
270.79	5.46	I guess it kind of killed any fear I have of putting stuff in my eye, dissecting eyes, learning about the eye.
277.17	5.7	Ophthalmology is like, you know, the eye is almost like the second or third most complex organ you have.
283.61	5.28	Anatomy gets really cool, especially when you look at disease stains versus healthy stains.
289.45	11.12	I think second only to the brain, arguably your gut, if you consider your gut a single organ, I think the eye and the surrounding milieu have one of the most interesting anatomies of all time.
301.77	5.38	I guess for a totally different change of topic, I'll be moving to Boston.
308.91	1.18	Boston housing is pretty brutal.
312.03	1.1	I guess the good thing is MIT has subsidized housing for students.
315.59	0.44	That's nice.
318.03	1.08	I'm only going to make $40,000 a year.
320.75	1.34	I've got to figure out how to make that work.
322.93	6.8	I basically do it now, but it's one thing to do it for four years and one thing to do it for six years when you're in your 20s.
332.31	1.5	I've got to figure out my salary.
334.11	5.48	It's actually when you see people making a lot of money out of CS, people making $150,000, $200,000 plus.
340.63	2.2	It kind of sucks, I guess, to make not much money.
344.61	4.56	I guess I really feel preaching to the choir of like, you guys are probably PhD students and don't get paid that much.
350.49	1.54	But at least you're unionized, and that's pretty good.
352.15	1.52	The fact that you can unionize.
356.19	1.76	Hopefully, it makes an increase in your stipends.
359.03	4.08	I know it's not that much, but at least Baltimore is a low-cost living area.
365.17	1.82	I guess we'll talk about Baltimore.
368.52	1.29	I think Baltimore is an underrated city.
371.05	2.04	I think people complain about it too much.
374.87	4.22	Even with crime, crime is so localized that we're almost in a bubble where we don't get affected by it.
379.27	1.94	Baltimore itself is a really cheap cost of living.
382.51	1.96	It's increasing, but it's still pretty cheap.
385.63	7.26	Relative to a lot of other places, I think it's still a very cool city, and a lot of cool culture and cool things to do and cool restaurants.
394.49	5.22	I do wish that there was better connectivity with DC besides MARC.
400.51	3.75	Amtrak is apparently going to run some nighttime lines from Baltimore to DC.
404.66	4.33	That could be really cool if you can go back to DC to Baltimore at 1 AM or 2 AM.
409.31	2.78	You don't have to worry about missing a MARC train.
412.83	14.1	I think it'd be cool stuff if people could commute from Baltimore or go to DC for the weekend, and not have to worry about missing a train on 5 PM on a Sunday and having to wait at the station for an hour.
428.38	1.71	I'm just scrounging about for stuff to say.
430.87	1.96	I hope I'm closing in on 10 minutes.
433.23	2.28	It feels like it's been an hour of me just sitting here talking.
437.07	2.02	I guess you can hear from the Word Association.
440.29	4.44	I'm not sure how they do the Word Association or the Word Game with the dot.
446.67	3.42	At least now that I'm thinking about the Word Game, I won't forget about the Word Game.
451.31	1.7	Now that's in my mind.
453.29	1.08	I guess it'll be the next thing.
456.25	1.48	I guess they'll mention it to me before and then it'll be the next thing.
459.13	2.42	That way I don't have to worry about forgetting about the Word Game.
462.13	3.08	At least I know what the Word Game is and I won't screw it up.
465.77	4.18	I still feel really bad about talking in the middle of the machine going off and thinking that was an audio.
471.27	0.23	That's pretty stupid.
471.65	1.42	I don't know what I was doing there.
475.67	1.6	I guess something totally different.
478.59	1.74	I've been thinking about graph theory homework.
480.33	2.22	I think graph theory, the homework for that class is kind of hard.
483.29	5.36	One of the problems is how do you look at coloring of labels.
489.35	6.72	You can prove that a graph is isomorphic to a graceful graph that somehow leads to graceful labeling.
496.57	2.52	I can label each edge with a different...
500.25	1.84	If I look at the vertices induced on those edges...
504.27	9.76	The edges induced on vertices A versus B, if A minus B is different for each edge vertex, then you can say that a graph is graceful.
514.65	2.46	But somehow you have to prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for that.
518.21	1.54	I'm still kind of unsure how to do that.
520.11	4.64	It's a weird math stuff, but I was trying to think of math things I haven't really talked about that much.
527.01	3.74	I guess also creating homework is kind of annoying.
533.12	1.16	I'm a TA and...
534.65	2.74	Creating homework can kind of suck because people make the same mistakes.
538.21	4.58	Complaining about the same problems is very obvious you don't get it wrong.
543.13	3.98	I also feel bad when people have to retake the class or don't do too well.
547.51	4.9	I try my best to help, but at some point you gotta be able to learn on your own.
553.05	4.54	I try my best to help you, but you got to be able to do something on your own.
558.63	0.64	It's a hard class.
559.65	1.42	Intro to Statistics, applied math department.
562.43	0.68	It's a hard class.
563.26	0.61	People do well.
564.53	4.86	I don't really know what I was doing until like semester 5.
571.27	2.6	I didn't know what I was doing until semester 3.
574.51	2.4	Now it's semester 5.
577.43	5.96	Now I can kind of worry about all the answers and all the homework.
583.89	1.56	I see the same questions over and over again.
585.85	2.62	Now I don't have to worry about helping people as much.
590.23	1.5	It's a different topic we can talk about.
594.29	0.78	I guess I don't have a baseball.
596.97	2.74	I've been getting into stand-up comedy, so I've been watching a lot of comedians.
