3.42	15.95	I was sitting at home on the sofa, watching the Office, and then I received a phone call to come to Hopkins, Kennedy Krieger, where I was last week or two weeks ago.
19.72	4.52	I got another brain scan, so I came over here in my car.
25.39	4.4	And then now I'm in the tube, and it's very loud.
30.46	3.96	But this tube is more comfortable than the tube down the hall.
34.48	6.78	I think compared to that tube, this one seems a little quieter even.
42.1	8.54	But that tube was a long time to be in for two hours, so I'm glad that this tube test was only one hour long.
51.59	12.95	Earlier today I was sitting on my sofa drinking some coffee, and I was on Zillow because I have to move in June.
65.16	1.79	So, I've been doing a lot of Zillowing.
67.72	9.47	And I'm nervous about my move because I'll been moving to Boston after being in Baltimore for ten years now.
78.08	2.98	And I feel like Baltimore is a very easy place to live.
82.47	5.46	There're not a lot of people here, and the apartments are very cheap.
88.48	2.62	Well, some of the apartments are cheap.
91.38	6.09	When I lived up in Charles Village, it was cheaper because I had a bunch of roommates.
98.18	7.97	There were three of us, and the place was nice, but it was old and it didn't have air conditioning, so it used to get really hot.
106.99	15.34	And then now I moved downtown, and the place is nicer because it has air conditioning and it has a washer and dryer, but it also has a lot of carpet.
123.38	1.92	And I'm not a big fan of the carpet
125.4	2.84	because I have a cat now.
128.81	2.95	And I think I'm a little allergic to the cat.
133.55	6.93	I'm not sure if it was the best decision to get a cat, but I do like having her.
140.51	3.62	She's sweet, although she's kind of mean sometimes.
145.77	3.76	But anyway, now I have a carpet
149.56	1.04	and I have the cat,
151.16	1.56	and she likes to eat the carpet.
152.9	11.52	So, now there's pieces of carpet everywhere and I had to get an air purifier because I think she creates a lot of dandruff on top of her eating the carpet.
165.75	7.14	So now that I'm going to move to a new place, I don't want to have carpet anymore.
174.75	10.23	But I also think moving to Boston is going to be a little difficult because it's very expensive, and there's a lot of people there.
185.62	12.45	So, when I was googling it, everything was like $2,000 or $3,000, and that's somebody who has no dollars and a lot of debt.
200.44	5.15	$2,000 sounds like a lot, but it is what it is.
206.31	11.68	So, I'm going to start my new job in July, and I'll just pay off my credit card debt when I get my first paycheck, which will be nice
218.98	7.07	since I haven't had a paycheck since my last job four years ago now.
228.0	11.6	I worked at the NIH, or not the NIH, I worked at the NCI in Gaithersburg, which I enjoyed.
240.85	9.42	I was doing some cancer epidemiology research, but I didn't really do too much there.
251.91	3.97	The only thing I really remember was the commute, which was like an hour each way.
259.09	11.1	So, for a little while, I got tired of commuting, and I decided to live in Gaithersburg for one month during my three months, just so I would stop having to drive every day.
271.5	15.62	And then at that time I moved, I got an Airbnb it was like $500 for the month because I was living with this old lady, and she had a spare room in her little townhouse, and the room was nice.
287.16	2.02	It was just a little twin bed and a desk.
290.85	8.33	But she had this tiny dog, and I think that dog must have been, she told me the dog was like 25 years old.
300.11	4.69	Like she got the dog in 1990, and this was in 2019.
305.86	14.52	So, she tried to tell me the dog was like aging on 30, and the dog definitely did look geriatric, but there's no way this tiny dog was 30 years old.
320.96	1.21	They don't live that long.
322.76	13.75	And so, the whole time I was there, the dog was like basically blind, and it would have like accidents, and she would take care of it like it was her child.
337.24	5.02	But I just couldn't believe her that the dog was 30, and it just like wasn't possible.
343.5	3.07	And then one time her daughter came by.
347.19	8.63	She was nice, she was actually working for BGE in Baltimore, so it was funny because now she was in Baltimore, I was in Gaithersburg.
357.29	9.99	But I didn't really like living in Gaithersburg, because there's literally nothing to do there except go to work and be at home.
368.23	5.8	But my favorite part about living there is that they had an H Mart, which was around the corner from the house.
376.35	15.19	And so, I ate a lot of sushi and kimbap that summer that I was working at the NCI, because I didn't feel like cooking in the kitchen with the dog.
394.8	13.45	And so, now I know that I really didn't want to move to the suburbs when I leave Baltimore, so I'm happy that I'm moving to the city of Boston.
408.41	9.82	But I don't really understand the geography of Boston, there's too many different places to live, and I still have to commute.
418.96	9.35	So, I'll be working in Brockton, which is like 45 minutes from Boston city center.
429.95	3.15	And I also don't really know if I'm prepared for the cold.
434.36	16.48	But I went to the new Patagonia store downtown on Caroline Street and Alisanna Street, and it's a really nice store.
451.59	6.23	I really like the selection they had, and I bought some t-shirts for like $7,
459.61	5.5	and I bought a jacket there a couple months ago for like $40.
465.88	7.83	And I was like, dang, usually a Patagonia jacket is like $200 and this thing is only $40.
475.81	4.76	Anyway, when I learned that I was moving to Boston, I bought a big jacket.
481.63	6.71	It's like a hefty one, it's like waterproof, and it goes down to my knees.
489.86	5.75	It kind of makes me look like the Michelin man, but I guess that's kind of what you need when it's snowing.
495.68	11.26	I'm not sure, it hasn't really snowed in Baltimore since, oh, my gosh, maybe 2015 when I got here.
509.09	4.25	That was the year of the polar vortex, I think.
513.43	0.79	I can't remember.
514.72	3.94	It was in January and there was like snow piles everywhere.
518.79	4.64	But honestly, since that year, there hasn't been too much snow in Baltimore.
524.59	12.92	This year, we had barely anything, but it's just been cold, although I wasn't here in December when they had that really, really cold front.
537.68	2.24	But I feel like this is too cold.
540.08	7.32	Like I'm from California, so I really wanted to go back to California or Seattle.
548.04	4.71	But well, now I'm going to Boston.
553.12	1.21	I don't really go to Chili's.
555.44	8.26	I'm going to be a psychiatry resident, so woo, should be fun.
565.76	1.93	My parents are in Northern California and...
568.78	2.51	I really like Los Angeles because it's warm.
572.36	4.15	And I like Los Angeles too because there's so much food to eat.
576.82	2.42	And I like that there's so much to do.
580.45	4.53	Although I always felt like when I was in Los Angeles, I was there in November for a month.
589.03	3.72	I was on an away rotation in an emergency psych.
594.71	6.03	I always felt like when I would go out, people would dress so nice.
