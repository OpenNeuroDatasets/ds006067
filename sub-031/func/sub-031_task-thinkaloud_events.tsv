1.21	9.58	Okay so I feel a lot of tension in my shoulders and I’m not really sure why
11.2	2.52	This place is actually really comfortable
13.97	8.6	I kinda like the the little small space and I like how smooth the interior of this tube is
22.57	1.27	It’s really nice
25.88	10.16	I always thought that like when when Savannah like says stuff it would be really loud or also in the headphones
36.04	3.35	I didn’t realize that it’s so hard to hear
39.39	4.49	I guess that’s why people don’t actually respond sometimes
43.88	4.08	I thought they were just being rude but maybe they can’t hear
48.37	2.13	Um I should not laugh
50.5	5.58	That would be bad um with all the head movement with that
59.8	3.17	I I don’t like
65.1	2.87	I feel like some- I I either have two modes
67.97	4.53	Either completely still or like constantly fidgeting
74.29	11.43	I still feel like that class thought I was crazy cause it was just zoom and I was moving around a lot
85.8	4.65	But I just am kind of naturally fidgety
90.45	8.35	But then like sometimes there’s days where I just don’t move at all
98.8	15.55	It’s probably really bad for me to just sit on the couch and like not uh leave one spot
115.02	4.17	Um maybe I should stop doing that
124.59	4.99	Should is kind of an interesting word
131.56	3.55	There’s so much to do with
135.11	3.72	Oh the screen just went dark or
138.83	1.22	Now it’s blue
141.05	5.76	I wonder why they made blank screens blu- like when there’s no signal, why is it blue?
147.85	2.04	It’s kind of a loud color
150.44	1.86	It’s like such an intense blue too
152.3	0.68	Why isn’t it-
153.8	4.94	I guess black would just make you assume that there’s no power so I guess that’s bad
160.57	3.26	I I said I guess I don’t have a solution to this
164.62	2.4	But I just don’t like the blue
167.02	2.04	It bothers me
172.4	3.99	Or just I guess or just a black screen with white text that says no signal
176.66	1.41	What’s wrong with that?
178.07	2.04	Why does it have to be a blue screen?
181.95	7.44	Or or even the snow from before like the old days on tv
191.61	2.81	I wonder why that happened too
194.42	3.36	Probably something to do with tv signals
199.6	1.95	TV is such a crazy idea
203.76	8.98	Like you just have pictures but they’re moving and they’re like being broadcast from somewhere else
213.38	3.09	I guess technology just amazes me a lot of time
217.19	1.91	I feel like we take it so much for granted
219.1	6.96	but it’s it’s not that easy
226.06	7.35	Also if if society completely collapsed tomorrow we would be pretty bad off
233.41	3.31	I feel like the average joe is
236.72	1.95	I don’t know I don’t know how to survive
239.22	2.49	I think about that a lot like
243.84	4.68	I I can’t find my own food
248.52	0.99	I can’t
249.51	1.59	I need to go to the grocery store
251.1	2.99	But what if the grocery store stopped existing?
255.76	1.04	That would be bad
261.88	5.13	Or like toilets are so nice and useful
268.34	3.67	But what if indoor plumbing stopped?
272.01	2.04	Oh that would be pretty terrible
275.39	1.59	Electricity
278.81	4.35	Yea it’s so easy to just like turn on my electric kettle
283.16	1.22	Oh I love my kettle
284.95	1.68	It’s so good
287.18	4.58	I think it’s probably other than the microwave the most used appliance in the house
292.34	7.8	And I think it was probably the best purchase I’ve made here in my four years at college
300.14	3.9	Because like I make tea
304.04	2.22	Everyone else uses it for instant coffee
306.26	4.44	It gets like at least three times of use a day
311.31	4.67	And then sometimes I have two cups of tea
315.98	4.54	Like my breakfast tea and then my looseleaf tea
320.52	5.85	Looseleaf tea is so much tastier than the stuff they put in bags
327.41	3.22	I can’t believe the difference
330.63	3.27	It’s it’s just so good
334.29	2.41	I I don’t know what to say
337.05	10.11	Um there’s like a there’s no word in English for it but there’s like a there’s like a nice aroma
347.16	2.5	I guess that would be a good descriptor
350.43	5.58	That just isn’t present in in like bagged green tea
358.2	1.86	Maybe I should look into white tea
360.06	1.5	but I think it’s kind of tasteless
362.68	1.0	Black tea
365.95	4.99	I milk and green tea is like I’m so
371.34	3.17	Feel like that’s really controversial because
374.51	4.67	Milk and black tea like I am a hundred a thousand percent for it
379.18	6.76	because it’s like it’s too strong on its own
386.67	3.9	It’s and it’s a little bit um what’s it called
392.08	6.76	Not coppery but a little bit ta- like a negative tangy
399.8	0.92	Not tangy
401.66	1.58	I don’t know what I’m trying to say
403.65	5.13	Um but it’s a negative feeling of taste
408.78	1.77	A negative taste
411.27	6.81	And the milk kind of takes away from that because it’s creamy and
419.35	6.35	And like whole milk adds enough sugar wise that I don’t feel the need to add sugar on top of it
426.24	2.04	So it’s like two birds one stone
428.83	1.77	I really like efficiency
430.6	5.42	But I realized that life isn’t all about like efficiency
436.02	3.99	And I don’t need to plan out the optimal route to my classes
440.01	3.22	Like I can just vibe sometimes and that’s pretty great
444.1	2.33	Um I can just enjoy the scenery
446.43	1.48	because Hopkins is so pretty
448.7	3.81	And I feel like it’s not appreciated
452.51	4.36	Although last year the flowers were not as nice as two years ago
456.87	3.9	But maybe I also just changed houses so there’s also that
460.77	6.76	But I’m pretty sure the weather last year wasn’t conducive to all of them blooming at once like they did two years ago
468.02	2.05	Also there was more snow two years ago
470.94	1.01	I like the snow
471.95	2.63	but I’m glad that I don’t drive
474.58	4.7	because I think driving in the snow would be kind of a nightmare
479.66	3.45	Like I hate driving in the not snow
484.69	1.73	I hate driving when it’s sunny
487.7	4.11	I guess I would hate driving when it’s sun’s in my eyes but like
493.41	3.36	I hate driving normally
496.77	7.53	But I also haven’t driven in like two years so maybe part of it is like that
504.62	1.86	I feel like a lot of things are like that
506.48	7.17	Like the more you’re avoiding something the worse it gets because it like builds up
514.47	3.33	Like I’m literally a worse driver than two years ago
517.8	1.7	because I haven’t driven in two years
520.55	2.73	So I think that I don’t want to drive
523.28	5.17	but that just makes it even worse
528.45	5.67	So maybe one of these days I should just rip off the Band-Aid
535.98	4.35	I I’m so confused about why my landlord
540.74	3.9	I’m confused about what she wanted this morning
545.51	2.14	Like why did it need to be moved up?
549.64	2.5	Like it’s fine
552.14	1.95	The appointment was fine where it was
555.34	7.43	And it’s the same day so I don’t understand what the urgency was
563.32	7.07	And we haven’t had an alarm system in like five months if not more
570.94	1.61	I think we’re fine on that front
572.55	2.95	I think what we really need to do is fix the door
576.56	4.02	I I feel like maybe I’m just weak
580.58	4.64	because like Anna didn’t have a problem with it but
586.4	1.22	Well now she does
587.62	3.9	I think she just didn’t get the door when it was at its worst
591.91	1.46	But then she also did
593.37	6.88	because that one time we didn’t leave through the front door for a week because it was stuck
