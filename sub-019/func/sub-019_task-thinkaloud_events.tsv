2.95	16.2	So um lying still for such a long time kinda makes me wanna like I don't know just move around a little bit.
22.39	5.67	Probably crack some of the joints like in my knuckles or whatever um.
29.8	2.48	But there are wires in the way of everything.
32.99	13.54	Don’t know where everything is and um I can’t really move my head either um that will mess up the scan and probably mess up the microphone position as well.
47.66	8.13	Um stories they were both pretty nice.
58.14	6.27	Um might not might not linger in my head for too long.
65.96	25.52	Um then the word chain game that one I mean as you might notice because I did say person women man camera TV that obviously the word chain game chain game reminded me of Donald trump.
93.8	0.86	Fun times.
95.78	4.64	I guess that’s his goal in life to be in everybody’s mind at all times.
101.28	0.88	So that’s fun.
105.47	14.86	Um the word chain game the first time around um I don't know I was I guess I must have been thinking of stuff from game of thrones?
121.49	6.31	I don't know um and also a love triangle at some point.
139.41	17.46	Something about lies and deceit probably asking weird questions trying to lead people to conclusions without telling them outright.
159.01	10.04	That stuff doesn’t doesn’t sit right but then again that’s why the show is made.
169.4	0.44	That’s life.
170.95	3.83	Stories are made like there’s gotta be conflict somewhere.
179.81	4.86	The beeping of this machine is quite loud not quite fun.
194.26	1.27	Wonder what time it is.
203.66	0.98	It’s been a while.
205.03	2.11	Must have been at least over an hour right?
208.96	1.18	No maybe not.
211.65	4.01	Short game chain game is like 2 minutes.
215.72	0.96	There were 3 of them.
218.3	6.42	Then stories were 15 minutes each so that’s probably been around an hour?
230.62	1.47	Maybe more since I got here.
234.22	4.4	Um I am a bit sleepy.
240.72	3.32	Took an afternoon nap and
244.27	8.8	uh I have these contact lenses which like reshape my eyes during the night so I can see better.
254.23	12.72	And for some reason when I take the naps that actually makes my vision go worse so I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to read everything 100% clearly but thankfully I was.
279.18	13.03	For this experiment ill probably take the money straight to the bank and cash it in cause I don't really have use for cash.
296.79	8.14	Yup haven’t bought anything with cash for a long time and um it’s just not a good idea to carry around cash all the time.
307.17	12.4	There’s a often a bunch of campus security alerts at Peabody talking about how you know people get mugged and attacked and weird stuff like that so.
322.19	5.92	Probably wanna get rid of the cash as soon as possible and put it in the bank.
330.82	3.67	Maybe invest that money in some sort of stock or something.
354.73	3.71	I had an uncomfortable conversation with a friend today.
363.43	1.61	Hope they’re not too mad at me.
368.62	7.54	I hope they understand that I was that I’m trying to help um.
382.69	8.47	And I have a physics exam in 2 days which will not be remotely fun.
394.22	4.74	This point I’m no longer really aiming for the A I just wanna pass.
404.33	9.44	Just wanna have not have to take it ever again because that crap is both boring and hard at the same time.
416.38	1.16	Confusing too.
422.99	16.03	That’s a required course which is not what I signed up for when I decided to do to go to Peabody Conservatory um.
452.03	1.98	Wonder if this is the last task.
455.58	8.99	Kinda wondering when this incessant beeping will end uh.
467.82	3.36	How long this this one task is supposed to even last.
499.22	2.91	Realized I have like very few pictures of myself.
504.93	3.67	Lot of people have just a ton of pictures.
508.6	3.76	They just take pictures every day and I don't I don't even know what they do with them.
512.79	3.6	Most of those pictures are completely useless um.
518.43	2.2	I don't know might be just the social media thing.
522.43	0.57	Kinda weird.
527.03	9.04	I usually think taking pictures is a bad idea because well you don't take pictures when times are bad you take them when they’re good.
537.11	3.28	Pictures are a way of lying to your future self.
554.34	15.27	But in any case I maybe do need at least a few pictures of myself that look halfway decent because um probably need them for professional purposes and other purposes.
571.22	3.6	Probably won't go into detail what those other purposes are.
581.69	1.64	And now I’m very sleepy.
588.85	1.96	I’m not done with classes for the day.
593.29	6.89	Still have a class period of like seminar.
