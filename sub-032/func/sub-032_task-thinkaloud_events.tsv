3.41	8.52	Okay so I was just thinking about the sound of the machine sounds like lightsabers going on like in Disneyland or like during Star Wars
11.93	2.91	I don’t know why it reminds me of that but it does
15.25	2.34	And I’m really sorry if I’m not speaking loud enough
17.59	1.45	I am trying
19.72	1.62	As well as trying to stay still
21.34	2.09	because I know I’m a talker with my hands
23.74	2.35	And it’s really hard to keep my body still
26.09	3.78	when I talk cause I like to express myself like physically as well
30.14	5.85	Um just heard a computer sound like the charger being plugged so I hope you have enough battery
36.54	9.75	Um I’m feeling like this breeze through the MRI machine which I’ve like tried to figure out for the past five minutes where it’s coming from
46.76	2.86	I don’t know if it’s like ventilated from inside or not
50.48	6.32	But my brain keeps thinking it’s like the magnetic waves from like the MRI machine
56.8	4.32	like pushing the air but I know that’s not really uh um
61.67	1.58	Heard the computer charger again
63.41	1.19	Hopefully your charger’s working
64.6	1.72	and not’s kinked like mine is
66.68	4.31	Cause my I know I have to like move my computer charger cord to the right position
74.24	1.95	Let’s see what’s on my mind
78.32	2.02	I was talking to my best friend Maddie
80.34	5.08	uh about another friend we have and some of his relationship issues
85.42	5.94	I’m kind of concerned for him just because it seems like the girl
92.27	2.44	This MRI is really loud oh my gosh
94.71	1.55	I forgot how loud it was
96.42	7.26	Last time I did this was freshman year and will admit completely fell asleep during the task cause it was like a driving task
104.67	5.08	And I don’t pay attention when it’s like a video of someone driving
110.7	4.26	Because I’m like in the passenger seat and I don’t have to pay attention
115.37	2.5	Um also I’m actually in the car
117.87	1.4	which I wasn’t
123.11	1.7	Our friend concerned
124.81	4.88	because this girl seems like he’s really or she’s really just wanting attention
130.51	1.31	And he doesn’t need that
132.87	1.95	So I hope he figures it out
135.33	3.72	But just erring on the side of caution because I want to like her
139.05	6.4	but with everything I’ve heard she doesn’t seem like a great fit for him if that makes sense
148.21	2.22	But yea I didn’t realize how cold this breeze was
150.97	6.98	Um I thought it was gonna be a lot like warmer like a warm summer’s breeze but no it’s kind of cold it’s like fall breeze
161.86	2.36	Yea tryna remember to breathe
166.35	3.4	Because when I talk I talk really fast and then I don’t breathe
172.47	3.36	And I also like in this MRI machine laying down I feel like I’m doing
176.9	6.31	What is it like a body mindfulness type of task like I did with my diabetes kids during our camp
183.97	7.9	Uh where we were just like laying down and just like focus on like each part of our body to like help us stay awake
192.53	1.5	But also to help us relax
194.03	1.9	And like I realized how tense I am
195.93	1.63	cause like when I’m lying down I like
198.63	4.63	Like I feel like I’m like not like restfully like laying down
203.54	3.63	It’s more like I’m trying brace myself up which is funny
209.67	8.16	But yea we just like focused on each body part and just like try to let the tension go away
218.19	0.71	But then I remember that
218.9	1.4	and then I’m like wait I can’t move
221.91	1.41	Feels really counterintuitive
224.14	6.98	This is this is what it kind of reminds me of like being in like a dark shelf thing
233.52	2.68	And trying to relax but not being able to
241.02	6.03	Yea I just keep hearing the really rapid beeping of this MRI machine
247.64	3.31	And like wow if this was a person’s pulse this would be really fast
252.08	2.5	Like dang their heart would be exploding out of their chest
257.04	2.12	Which reminds me of like I volunteer at the ER
259.16	2.55	and like I’ve never see anything like this
263.69	2.58	At the ER at least in my time volunteering
266.27	3.99	But it’s been a cool experience getting to see other things
270.26	1.95	And trying to figure out if I want to do medicine
276.17	2.9	Yea the only thing I can really focus on right now is the beeping
281.29	2.13	And hoping the computer is charged
286.56	6.48	Yea I see this like white little plus thing to help me fixate on the screen
293.9	1.54	But there’s nothing happening on the screen
295.64	4.12	so I’m like afraid something’s gonna just like jump out of the screen and scare me
302.93	5.35	Weird cause I’m not really into horror movies unless I’m like watching them with someone so it would not appeal to me
311.38	4.95	Oh I did go see a movie recently for like the first time in forever in an actual theatre
319.26	2.81	With my friends and my boyfriend
322.07	0.87	And we saw this movie
322.94	2.26	and I was really confused by it
326.71	1.31	Oh the air stopped
328.84	1.04	That’s weird
329.88	4.45	It’s like you’re listening to me which I know you’re listening to me and it’s a weird concept
334.82	1.86	Because I know people are listening to me
338.81	0.64	So that’s weird
339.45	2.95	But thank you if you are listening to me for the air
342.4	1.04	I appreciate it
346.88	0.95	Okay breathing remembering to breathe
354.71	1.45	Beeping is still loud
357.11	4.59	I’m sure you get that comment in these tasks
362.24	1.32	Everyone mentioning the beeping
363.56	1.68	So I’m sorry if I’m repetitive
370.15	4.08	Now I’m like really aware of this like pulse ox on my finger
375.36	1.13	I don’t know why
376.49	2.5	But I’m just like very aware that it’s there
382.73	5.4	I’m also really aware of like this pad thing that’s on my chest measuring my breathing
389.03	1.86	And you’re probably like this girl does not breathe at all
390.89	2.45	which like I don’t but ya know
397.17	6.26	But yea weird I’ve never had them on me before besides the pulse ox at like a doctor’s appointment but
405.56	5.16	Yea a different feeling to be like very hyper aware of like my breathing
410.72	2.44	and hoping that my pulse is not through the roof
413.16	5.37	because I’m weird and my pulse is really fast when I lay down but like really slow when I stand up
420.27	1.13	Yea tried to figure that one out
421.4	1.42	The doctor’s can’t figure it out either
422.82	4.25	so you know we’re just gonna like go on the assumption that I’m still alive
427.89	0.95	We’re gonna roll with it
434.08	3.44	But yea realizing that ten minutes is a lot longer than five
438.8	1.95	Um when I practiced this
444.0	6.57	But yea I’m like tryna look around
451.4	1.54	There’s not much to see
454.58	7.08	Which really cool set up that there’s like the screen like above the machine and there’s these weird glasses or goggles
461.66	2.76	I don’t really know how I can see the screen if it’s like
464.42	5.06	Like is there a hole in the MRI machine so I can see the screen?
470.14	6.39	And like the rest of my body is covered or is it just a projection?
478.39	3.27	Not a hundred percent sure but it’s cool
483.61	4.38	I also see this minor like flashing
487.99	2.92	and I’m like wondering if it’s from the machine like below the screen
492.8	2.13	It’s not like really flashing but like
496.01	5.86	You know like when you see the heat waves on like the concrete when it’s really hot in the summer?
502.46	1.09	Kinda like that
504.96	2.04	But like a lot faster
507.0	2.59	like in time with the beep of the machine
510.31	5.44	I’m like you can’t really see magnetic waves so like what am I seeing
519.6	3.63	But yea this reminds me of physics class quite honestly
523.99	3.45	That’s what we talked about all the time in physics
528.07	3.81	It was you’re going to need to know physics to wor- know how to work an MRI machine
532.38	2.4	And I’m like no sir I probably do not
535.63	2.22	I just hope the machine works and go with that
537.85	2.54	I trust the engineers who built it
547.0	1.86	But yea remembering to breathe again
549.87	1.04	I’m really bad at that
552.18	3.22	Can’t just like get in my head and forget to breathe
556.26	1.77	Also trying to remember to talk loudly
558.03	1.21	because I know the machine’s loud
559.24	1.56	but I’m not loud person
561.69	1.59	I’m a very quiet person
567.77	1.95	Oh also remembering my friend group
569.72	3.75	We’re going we’re having a powerpoint night tonight
573.47	4.77	because one of my best friend Maddie she went to Singapore with one of my other friends
578.7	0.95	And they’re back now
580.29	2.85	So I’m excited to see what they did and what adventures they’ve gone on
586.91	5.2	I’m also hopening this the friend she traveled with Will I’m hoping he’s opening up to me
592.11	5.76	I didn’t really get to know him super well when I first came into like this friend group
598.86	1.95	And then he left for Singapore
