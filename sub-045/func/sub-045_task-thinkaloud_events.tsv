1.78	2.35	I'm in an MRI machine, it's pretty cool.
4.81	3.18	I was in the lobby 45 minutes too early.
8.7	1.18	I don't know why I did that.
10.17	4.03	I guess I was excited and also didn't wanna... Didn't wanna be late.
14.66	7.64	Umm, I've been working with OERO, the, uh, On-campus Emergency Response Organization to fix our amnesty policy.
23.05	7.11	It's just super vague right now, and kids aren't calling for EMS help, because they're scared that they're gonna get in trouble.
30.87	11.68	The weirdest thing is when I was reading the policy earlier, it says that they shouldn't get in trouble, but then there's a lot of conflicting paragraphs down the... Umm, later on and, and, they'd like to use this word may.
42.8	1.74	So there's never a complete amnesty.
44.69	5.64	And I feel like that's why we were responding to so many drunk kids left in alleys and that's just not safe.
51.25	2.75	I, uh, I was recently elected president.
54.68	8.35	I feel a lot of responsibility, umm, honestly more responsibility than excitement at this point, but I feel like I'm gonna do okay.
63.53	3.75	I have a great team behind me and I'm excited to to get started with them all.
69.1	2.43	My coach sat me down the other day about swimming.
71.78	3.82	I've, uh... I got really sick at the end of the semester and had to miss a meet.
76.35	5.21	He thinks I do too much, and honestly, I never thought that it would be true.
81.66	6.39	Umm, I've always done a lot of different things, but now I really do think that I might have stretched myself too thin.
88.8	1.79	I don't wanna give up everything though.
90.73	6.89	I feel like quitting isn't something that's honorable, but we'll see what I end up deciding on doing.
98.94	6.03	I don't really do too much else other than work, and a lot of times that makes me feel sad.
106.25	4.68	I broke up with my girlfriend recently, maybe we'll talk about some emotional things.
111.57	5.39	Umm, she was great, just didn't work because I was too busy.
119.35	1.57	I, uh, I enjoy going to the beach.
121.1	1.64	I miss home a lot.
123.35	0.96	I really miss Florida.
124.81	7.46	I, uh, I wanna go hang out with my little brother, put a hammock up on two palm trees and surf with him.
133.77	1.22	I'd do anything for that little guy.
135.09	1.07	He's, he's really great.
136.27	9.64	He goes to the University of Chicago and, umm, he said he was gonna triple major like me, but he, uh... The curriculum there just isn't as flexible as Hopkins.
146.3	5.35	So he ended up doing, umm, business econ and, uh, cancer bio.
152.47	9.93	Uh, a friend of mine here actually got him into a research lab at, at UChicago, and now he's growing cancer cells, which, uh, I got to see that over Thanksgiving break when he got me sick.
162.83	1.92	Umm, it was just really, really cool.
164.9	6.56	Cancer cells growing in Petri dishes, apparently you just have to give them a little bit of glucose and they go crazy.
172.03	5.79	Umm, so he showed me that and then he showed me all of their freezers and labs and experiments.
179.1	8.42	He thought he was showing me something new when he started pipetting, but, uh, [chuckle] I think he forgot that I, I go to Hopkins, and we have to do that for our labs, too.
188.67	4.14	I don't know, sometimes I'm worried that he's a little too nerdy.
193.09	4.89	I know that's kind of mean to say, but he, uh, he doesn't spend enough time with his team.
198.13	1.46	He's always in his room studying.
200.44	7.0	I don't know if that's just him or maybe I should have done something while we were growing up to help socialize him more.
208.58	11.82	Umm, I am proud of him though, not only 'cause of college but he also, uh, he also got his EMT license like me, and that was... That was really nice.
220.44	3.6	I gave him my stethoscope to, to tell him thank, like congrats.
224.06	7.36	And, umm, I don't know, he never really said thank you for helping him do it or study or get going.
231.57	11.52	But I feel like at a certain point we, uh... I don't know, I just feel like we still are... We're still brothers and we know that we love and appreciate each other.
243.52	2.97	It's a weird 'cause we never really say it, but I know it's there.
247.7	1.21	I have a lot of stuff to do.
249.06	1.14	I have a lot of finals.
250.55	3.22	Uh, I'm not looking forward to the, the two that are remaining.
254.19	1.18	One of them is research methods.
255.52	3.64	That's how I found this MRI study, fMRI study.
259.91	2.71	Umm, I've never participated in one of these before.
262.76	2.36	I don't know if I can talk for a whole 10 minutes straight.
265.69	2.07	It seems very one-sided [laughter].
268.54	11.46	Umm, but we'll try and, umm, yeah, I really enjoyed the class, umm, on the days I would attend, I just feel like one hour and 45-minute lectures are a bit much.
280.5	7.74	And I guess that should have been a warning not to sit in an MRI machine for an hour and a half, but if I can do it in class, I can do it here.
288.6	4.93	The only difference is this one's a little bit more meaningful in terms of what the potential impacts could be.
294.24	3.28	Umm, I picked up psychology on a whim.
297.7	16.42	I actually wanted to get more leadership experience, and I was reading all of these books, and I realized that every time organizational psychology was employed it was... Or at least in leadership, every time somebody studied leadership, they were framing it through a psychological lens, organizational or otherwise.
314.62	3.64	"And I thought, ""Well, why would I... Why would I waste time with the leadership minor?"
318.69	12.13	"It was very, very basic stuff when I could get at the root of, of what, uh, what they're using to actually understand what makes somebody, uh, an outstanding leader and what makes people wanna follow them."""
332.29	8.96	I guess I have a couple of passions, EMS and... And I, I, I think that my longest and my biggest one is, is being someone that others look up to.
341.75	9.46	I, I love the feeling when my brother looks up to me and I like being able to help others, especially, uh, especially in, in long-term like team environments.
351.61	19.08	It's one thing to, to show up on a scene as an EMT and help somebody when it's their emergency, but it's another to, to be in charge of another EMT and train them up and show them this is what the question... Like these are the questions you need to ask, uh, these are the, the little... These are the ropes basically, umm, and just give them advice.
371.8	3.28	Uh, without breaking HIPAA, I'll talk about a call I had.
376.47	10.25	There was a, uh, a drunk patient who had hit his head and I was... It was my third call as a field training officer.
386.81	4.4	So I was directly responsible for, for running the scene and treating the patient.
391.89	2.0	And he had been throwing up for two hours.
394.0	4.49	They were scared to call because our amnesty policy is so broken at Hopkins.
399.71	4.96	And I got on scene and my EMT was great, she took vitals, got a glucose for me.
405.31	5.89	But the... Uh, we have a, uh, a protocol that says that we can't transport.
411.66	3.4	So BCFD is automatically dispatched on all of our calls.
415.48	7.46	We usually get there first just because we understand campus a little bit better, and, umm, our EMT literally runs there to wherever it is.
423.12	3.89	But this time, our patient was A&Ox2.
427.48	3.23	Umm, that's a scale we use to assess how alert they are.
431.01	5.35	Alert and oriented times two means they were only alert to two of the four, like, main questions we asked them.
436.93	7.43	Umm, this patient was only alert to their name and the, uh, the time, not the place or the event.
444.39	4.61	They had no idea what had happened, umm, and they had no idea where they were.
449.21	1.0	It was pretty scary.
450.75	2.21	Umm, glucometer said everything was good.
453.74	6.61	All the vitals were normal, but this patient, per MIEMSS protocols, definitely couldn't refuse treatment.
460.95	11.51	And when BCFD got there, which they're... They have decades of experience on me and they're definitely better 'cause they're, they're medics, they have training, but they wanted to refuse the patient.
472.55	0.57	And I get it.
473.16	3.07	I mean, he was covered in vomit, I wouldn't wanna put him on my stretcher.
476.98	10.67	But it was just sad to see that somebody could see somebody who's in need of help, have their job be to help them and still wanna refuse them when they shouldn't.
488.69	7.31	So that's kind of the crux I'm... That's kind of the hill I'm gonna die on for, for our unit.
496.22	8.24	I'm gonna make sure that we can fix something or at least make a change, umm, no matter how small, so that way stuff like this doesn't happen again.
505.1	4.56	And I think that the way to do that is fixing our amnesty policy at the university,
509.7	8.01	cause I feel like if they would've called us sooner, two hours even, the patient had, was A&Ox4, and just really, really drunk.
517.95	3.64	We could have talked him into to getting checked out, especially after he hit his head.
522.38	1.96	But they just waited too long 'cause they were scared.
525.2	3.67	Because of that, I don't know, there's a lot of things that could have gone differently.
530.73	5.35	I, uh, a lot of times when I think about my parents, I think about my dad.
536.26	9.78	Umm, my mom has cancer and she's sick and it makes me sad, but she's been battling with it for so long that I feel a little numb to it, and I don't think that's a good thing.
546.08	3.2	But I do see it happen to just about everybody.
549.31	2.12	I mean, it happens with sounds, too.
552.04	5.46	You hear the AC turn on and then after a while you don't hear it anymore, even though it's still as noisy as it was.
558.17	1.17	It's, uh, what do they call that?
559.45	1.1	Sensory adaptation.
561.64	6.01	But, umm, my dad, when I was in second grade, he gave me, uh, he talked to me.
567.86	2.86	I had a school project, I remember, it was Mrs. Lafferty.
571.16	8.57	She handed me a sheet with five different questions on it, or, or five different projects and said, I get to choose two to, to do and bring to class over the weekend.
580.3	5.72	"Umm, and I showed my dad and I was like, ""I have this one that I really wanna do, but I'm not sure what the second one should be."""
586.56	4.04	And my dad told me that I was gonna do them all, because you always do more than expected.
591.53	7.7	"And I used to think that was my mantra for life, ""Always do more than expected,"" but sometimes it's just unreasonable."
599.33	8.32	I mean, I don't wanna sound, uh, bad, but, you know, you don't always need to go above and beyond, sometimes 80% is enough.
