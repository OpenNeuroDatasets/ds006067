2.02	2.08	Feels very hard to talk.
6.85	1.27	It's like a spaceship.
12.73	6.46	There're a lot of sounds, so it's hard to hear what I'm thinking.
22.52	1.53	I think I'll get used to it.
27.21	5.05	I'm a little hungry because I didn't have breakfast,
33.36	2.07	so I'm looking forward to lunch.
41.03	12.29	I packed leftovers from my lunch on Sunday where I made a dry pot with Shirley.
54.49	1.08	It was really fun,
56.12	11.85	and I think I should hook more of my friends and enjoy the time that I have with them before I leave Baltimore.
70.52	7.72	It reminds me that I have to figure out what things, furniture I'm selling or keeping.
79.25	14.91	It's a little stressful to have to decide on what to move and think about moving when I haven't really figured out where I'm going next year.
94.42	13.68	But I try not to think about it because I can't really control it, so I don't want the negative energy to infiltrate my daily life.
109.48	3.09	It was really fun going to the gym early this morning.
112.89	3.34	I haven't gone to the gym early in a really long time.
116.96	6.34	It was really sunny when we were walking out of the apartment to go to the gym.
125.87	5.76	It reminded me a lot of my freshman year because of the crisp breeze.
131.67	2.43	So, I feel like I should do that more.
137.29	4.73	The sound feels like little lasers shooting into my head.
145.51	1.64	Thinking about what I should make for dinner.
147.45	6.44	If I should heat up leftovers, or I should make something new.
154.77	1.69	Maybe I'll make pasta again.
157.68	5.94	Excited to go to Jersey next week to visit my friend and his family.
167.39	4.58	I have to figure out how to get back because I didn't buy my return tickets yet.
173.22	3.09	But I'll just wait for his response.
178.6	2.93	Looking forward to going to Japan this summer.
182.43	6.42	I haven't been abroad with friends in forever actually.
189.09	8.67	And it'll be fun to spend half a month not worrying about anything and just exploring.
198.57	3.42	But I'm a little concerned about how much money I'm going to spend.
202.89	9.9	But I guess money is meant to be spent, so I shouldn't worry too much or it'll take away from the experience.
214.51	8.0	Wish I could go back to China to see my grandparents because it's been a couple of years especially with COVID.
224.56	4.34	I really miss them and my aunt.
230.49	5.19	I'm really looking forward to eating delicious food in Asia.
238.27	4.34	And looking forward to the onsen in Japan.
244.35	2.98	I need to figure out what outfit I should wear.
249.48	5.48	I'm trying not to buy clothes before I leave because I know I'll buy clothes there.
255.45	3.17	But I also don't want to wear clothes I don't like there.
259.92	3.04	So maybe I'll buy a couple of things.
263.72	4.22	It's been a while since I've been shopping just because I've been a little busy.
269.95	5.61	It would be nice to go browse and window shop.
275.85	6.77	I'm also scared that I would be impulsed and buy a lot of different things.
284.01	4.15	I was last going to a mall a few weeks back with Maggie.
290.98	1.96	It was nice to catch up after a while.
293.96	2.15	We have a dinner this Wednesday.
297.25	7.43	I need to plan with Annie, but we haven't talked about it even though Wednesday is tomorrow.
305.35	6.08	The schedule is pretty flexible, so if we have to push it back that's totally fine too.
312.82	6.76	Wondering if I should go to the gym after work today, and if so what I should do.
321.98	4.66	I feel like I want to run more because I want to do my 5k this summer.
327.85	1.69	But also, I'm feeling a little tired
330.27	1.14	so maybe I won't run.
332.71	1.8	I'm wondering if I should have coffee,
335.8	3.71	but I'm trying to drink less caffeine.
340.81	6.37	Because I feel like I can feel the caffeine withdrawal sometimes.
347.93	7.7	I'm also trying to develop a better sleeping schedule without reliance on caffeine.
357.92	8.47	I should meditate and journal, and put on my diffuser.
368.1	2.68	It was nice yesterday just relaxing.
372.64	1.49	I'm excited for spring to come
374.37	14.46	because I feel like when spring is here I am able to feel happier.
389.09	9.19	Because the days are longer I feel like I have more daytime left to do stuff because of the sunsets early.
398.44	3.37	I feel very unmotivated,
402.98	3.24	which is why I'm very excited for summer also because of a trip.
409.19	2.18	It's been a while since I've had a free summer.
413.85	10.13	The beeping of a machine is helpful because it makes me feel like I'm not in a space right now.
424.06	10.07	It feels like I'm talking but it's just thoughts in my head so it doesn't feel like I'm actually speaking out loud.
435.18	3.8	Which is helpful because I feel like I'm able to talk more clearly.
446.66	2.55	It was fun playing badminton this morning and volleyball.
450.51	4.68	I wish I got to try more sports when I was younger.
456.05	0.76	It would have been fun,
457.08	12.17	but it's never too late, so I can still dabble in different things and new hobbies.
469.91	8.96	Definitely want to try to maximize experiences while I am more free this year compared to next year when school starts.
479.88	7.87	I'm a little nervous for school because I feel like there's going to be a lot of information.
488.59	5.29	And I'm not really sure which specialty I want to go in yet.
493.96	1.12	It's still kind of early.
496.16	3.72	But I think it's good to have a general idea.
501.5	1.71	I'm excited to meet new people.
503.48	7.59	I feel like it'll be a good change of pace and nice to go to a new city and meet new people.
511.13	2.06	Kind of have a fresh start.
514.01	6.44	And I really miss learning because this year, without a year of not learning,
521.78	3.73	I feel like I'm ready to jump back in and have that structure.
526.16	4.46	And really learn about things that excite me.
532.46	8.25	But also, scared because I feel like there's a lot of information that maybe...
542.12	10.03	I don't know if I'm able to have good studying habits, but I'm trying to work towards building better habits and having a better work-life balance.
553.35	8.61	Which is why I want to keep on going to the gym and set time aside to eat well when I'm in school.
562.05	11.78	Because I feel like when I was younger, just working all day, it was kind of counterproductive.
574.69	5.63	Where I did work, but it wasn't very efficient and I just felt really burnt out.
580.44	3.49	I really want to avoid being burnt out as long as possible.
583.95	2.74	Even if it's inevitable in the end.
587.61	1.25	I'm excited to see family.
590.89	4.26	I'm excited to go back to Ohio next month to see family.
597.36	4.75	And to see the new house because I haven't seen it yet.
