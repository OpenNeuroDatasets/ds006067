1.5	3.73	I was a bit nervous before coming here.
5.24	6.84	I wasn't sure what to expect from this study, but now that I'm here, I feel much more, I'm feeling much more calm.
12.58	11.27	Um, on the way over here, I was really scared about missing the stop for, um, for the bus, but I ended up getting off at the right stop.
23.9	1.5	A lot of people got off on the same stop.
25.41	1.41	So that was very helpful.
27.95	2.12	And I also ran into ZM.
30.3	2.95	Oh, that was... That reminded me of the test.
33.53	1.73	The test is happening at 6:00 PM.
35.31	10.14	I studied a lot for it, but I still feel a bit unsure about what my results were, what, how am I gonna do on it.
46.09	8.18	The midterm, I didn't do so well, which I actually, while I was taking it, I really felt sure about how I was doing on it.
54.89	6.09	But afterwards, I, after getting the results, I real, um, I really didn't do a good job.
61.62	4.29	This time I studied more, so I suppose it's going to be so much better.
66.56	4.77	I also have another midterm on Wednesday that I have to study for.
71.76	4.31	I already know most of the things that are gonna be on it, so I think I'm going to be fine.
76.86	13.82	But there's definitely, there's definitely some lectures that I have to go over and some books that I need to reread again, well, some paragraphs, some short stories maybe, the short stories are the ones that I have to go over.
91.33	8.11	There's also the test on Thursday at, I think... I don't remember what time that one is.
99.45	1.9	I think it's at 9:00 AM.
101.95	4.22	I'm going to have to check again to make sure because I don't wanna miss that one.
106.24	2.88	That one's very important for my grade, for that class.
109.44	2.24	I have a C so far in that class.
112.37	12.42	I think, um, I think it's at 9:00 AM but, if I remember correctly, the only exams that I had at 6:00 PM are Research Methods and Intro to Psych.
125.41	2.54	So that one has to be the one that's at 9:00 AM.
132.93	5.74	Intro to Psych is at 9:00 AM because Research Methods is at 6:00 PM.
138.78	5.9	Oh no, my English one is at 6:00 PM so that means that the Intro to Psych one is at 9:00 AM.
145.26	2.02	I did study hard for that one as well.
147.7	2.26	I turned in everything on time so I'm not worried.
150.07	2.05	I'm not so worried about the assignments.
152.54	2.42	It's just the midterm that was definitely hard.
155.07	2.95	That class was very hard this semester.
158.12	3.61	It was one of my most challenging classes.
162.31	5.67	The professor is, was not the best one.
168.51	4.31	He was in... His teaching, his teaching methods weren't the best.
173.35	4.19	I definitely have my favorite teachers this semester and also my favorite TAs.
178.58	16.55	I think that's, um, I think that's what made it much more easier in my English classes because of Jung-min and Nadia were definitely better TAs than the one from Intro to Psych.
196.42	6.7	Well, I guess that's why I'm struggling in Intro to Psych mostly, but also the TA really didn't reach out to us.
203.19	2.56	There wasn't any section, so that was kind of hard to keep up with.
205.84	4.82	So I guess that's why I'm struggling a little more there as well.
211.67	8.07	I have to do much more better next time to reaching out with a professor more 'cause I think that would've helped out a little more.
220.06	11.46	But it was also a little difficult because he, his timings, his schedule for, for hours after class was a little difficult with my other classes.
232.37	8.09	I also have to... I also have to go to the gym at... I don't think I'm gonna be able to go to gym today.
240.73	4.48	I'm gonna have to go tomorrow morning right before I have my meeting.
245.22	4.57	I have a meeting at 11:00 PM, 11:00 AM now that I remember.
250.83	2.86	That meeting is going to be with my sociology professor.
253.7	2.41	I also have to finish the assignments for that class.
256.75	8.11	Um, I think I have one big report that I have to finish only and the small report for the small roles.
265.88	3.15	The meeting is for the report three, so I don't understand.
269.77	2.91	Maybe that might help me with report four.
273.69	2.24	Although all the instructions are on report four.
275.95	11.13	It's always self-explanatory, so I don't think I'll have trouble finishing that one, but he could, I could ask him for help to review what I have done so far.
287.91	7.79	Um, there's also my, my appointment at the Health and Wellness Center at 1:00 PM.
295.84	4.12	I have to make sure that the meeting with the sociology professor finishes before that.
300.35	2.42	After that, I'm going to probably study.
303.35	5.44	I have to make sure that my schedule is very tight on that day because there's a lot to finish.
309.83	1.03	Um, there's a lot to do.
310.87	6.86	I didn't get to, I didn't get to say goodbye to my friend Seth who is leaving today after his exam.
318.47	3.18	I'm not gonna get there back in time in order to say bye to him.
321.66	4.64	I, his exams started at 9:00 AM and he's gonna finish at 12.
326.97	3.78	So he's going to leave soon after his exam.
330.82	4.68	I'm not gonna be able to reach him, but I did get to say goodbye to him through text.
335.57	1.22	We wish each other well.
337.39	2.74	So I don't feel the worst about that.
340.22	1.85	But I definitely wish I could have seen him.
342.62	1.96	I just think I did get to say goodbye.
344.59	2.2	I did get to hang out with Edwin and say goodbye.
347.07	7.95	She's leaving today after the exam, Ashley's gonna be all alone in her room, so I'm gonna have... I'm gonna ask her if she wants to go stay over at our place.
355.48	4.65	Me and my roommates, since a couple of them are already leaving.
360.46	3.96	Alonso and me are leaving on the 23rd, very early in the morning.
364.49	4.79	We have to find out whether we're gonna leave at 6:00 AM or earlier.
369.93	3.94	There's, we either have to decide whether we're gonna take the train.
374.65	1.16	It's really tight.
376.06	2.72	It's really cutting it close if we take the train though.
379.52	4.4	We're probably not gonna make it on time for my flight, which is the earliest one.
384.01	3.57	His is later, but I won't be able to make it to mine.
388.73	6.48	It's way too early and the train to catch it, well, we could take an Uber to the train.
395.9	7.54	We'd have to decide on that day whether we're going to take the train, take an Uber to the train or take it to the airport.
403.46	7.65	I think it would be best to just take it to the airport much more direct and avoiding the trouble of taking two routes.
411.16	1.86	Two things to have to rely on.
413.16	5.1	So I think it's just going to be best to take the Ubers directly to the airport.
418.79	3.24	I have to make sure that all my stuff is packed the day before.
422.5	2.48	I guess, I have to start packing today.
425.08	1.84	I don't wanna forget anything else.
426.99	5.3	I also have to make sure that I clean up all of the room and the kitchen and the living room and the bathroom.
432.31	2.08	This weekend that's coming up is my turn to clean.
435.06	10.09	So I have to make sure that that's done the day before I leave, or even sooner if possible, so that I'm not worrying about that that day.
445.66	4.72	There's also some dishes that I realized aren't in the cabinets.
450.86	3.21	I wonder who took them, I'm not sure.
454.08	3.45	I think I saw someone using it the other day when we were cooking.
458.37	9.66	They... I think Daniella was using it when she was making the spaghetti, but she usually brings it out.
468.1	5.63	So I'm not sure if I moved to somewhere else or if it's still being used by someone.
474.51	8.69	I'll have to ask Daniella to see if she still has it and make sure to remember right after because I forget that real easily.
483.27	2.3	So I think I won't remember to tell her.
485.71	1.87	I have to text her as soon as I get out.
488.27	8.71	I also have to ask Alonso if he's going to want to eat dinner or if he's going to skip studying for his exam on Wednesday.
498.82	2.7	Ashley also has an exam on Wednesday.
501.53	11.95	I don't know if she's going to want to do a all-nighter again or what she's going to wanna do because she did tap out this... The one time that we stayed up all night.
513.55	4.77	I don't wanna keep her up that late if she's not going to be, be able to stay up.
519.22	14.03	Edwin needs to go to sleep earlier than us, she doesn't rest and we both realized after going back through all the notes and stuff we reviewed for the other exam, that it was just best to have gotten some sleep.
533.26	7.02	So I think I'm gonna tell Ashley that an all-nighter is definitely not the best option because what we know, we already know.
540.95	3.64	And yeah, the all-nighter is not the, not the best plan.
545.28	5.0	She was also very tired and she was talking about drinking way too much caffeine.
550.38	1.56	That's definitely bad for her.
552.34	1.59	She's already talking about migraines.
554.06	1.78	I don't wanna have a migraine either.
556.34	2.03	Those are very horrible for me.
558.49	0.55	I've had some horrible.
559.16	15.0	I had one the other week, I'm not sure why if I have been keeping up with all of the triggers and making sure that I don't drink too much caffeine or eat too much greasy food.
575.04	1.88	I'm not sure what triggered it.
576.99	1.5	But I'm gonna have to keep more track.
579.81	6.22	Maybe there's other triggers that are, that I haven't discovered yet that are creating the migraines.
587.25	7.9	I definitely have to talk about that with my, with the doctor because I also stopped birth control.
595.71	3.22	So that means there could be something there.
598.98	7.54	Um, after the stopping birth control.
