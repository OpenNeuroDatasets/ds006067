5.8	2.72	fMRI machine is very loud.
10.3	15.15	I've been thinking whether...I don't know, I guess I can be quite...worried about things, small random things.
26.4	4.85	I mean, I know MRI machines are not really harmful, but...
31.88	5.29	Also, I was just wondering, why can't you be in the fMRI machine when you're pregnant?
39.44	2.61	Does that affect the baby somehow?
43.25	6.02	Also, if it's a big magnet, does it have any?
50.46	4.75	Well, I know MRI machines aren't like CT or X-ray, it's not...
56.46	4.02	like that harmful, but is it harmful in any way?
61.03	3.62	Like if you were in the MRI machine for...
66.08	6.3	say, like, every day for a couple years, would that affect your body?
73.69	1.98	I don't know, I was just thinking about that.
81.33	8.76	Also, I was just thinking about, I don't know if I asked this before, but...am I allowed to close my eyes while I'm getting the scan?
90.97	2.94	Also wondering if you guys can hear me right now.
103.15	2.44	I guess I feel a little thirsty.
110.68	4.85	It's not as cold as I remember, so that's good.
115.68	3.74	Or maybe I just layered up a lot than last time.
120.23	2.33	Although my arms are getting a little cold.
126.38	2.71	Also, this goggle thing in front of me...
129.96	4.08	The divider is a little dizzying.
135.75	6.6	Why is there, like, a goggle thing in front of the mirror?
143.64	2.18	What if we just didn't have that divider?
147.18	2.03	What is the purpose of this divider?
160.89	1.76	Nothing much thinking going on.
164.83	3.87	Oh, no, I think I moved my head a little bit there, I hope it's okay
178.27	2.41	I don't know, nothing much is coming to my mind.
182.76	2.64	Except that this mirror is a little bit dirty.
186.93	2.87	But I can't really see it unless I focus on it.
202.4	2.62	Why does that screen not fill up the whole screen?
206.04	1.03	Does it matter?
208.31	9.71	Last time, when I shattered Hailey, it was filled because I think maybe because of the Sherlock movie.
218.98	1.98	But I guess it doesn't matter for this one.
225.76	1.56	Ten minutes is very long.
241.63	2.04	Not much coming to my mind other than...
245.14	1.79	I think I have a slight headache.
252.26	1.9	On my left temporal lobe.
284.96	4.39	Also just going back to the stickers on the machine.
289.96	3.03	Do kids get less scared when there are stickers on the machine?
297.49	5.42	I mean, it definitely makes them look cuter and I guess less intimidating.
375.19	2.82	Wait, is ten minutes still not past?
378.98	3.14	Wow, ten minutes is really long.
386.09	1.81	I wasn't really thinking of much.
388.75	1.54	Nothing is really coming to my mind.
391.59	3.17	Other than the last time.
395.56	1.66	It was pretty, I don't know.
398.25	2.61	My body felt a little bit uncomfortable, but my head felt comfortable.
401.76	2.57	But today my head feels a little uncomfortable.
404.9	4.02	Mostly because of the earphones.
409.06	1.72	Yeah, they're still kind of digging in.
411.22	1.14	But not too bad.
412.41	2.51	I think I can bear it I think.
415.83	2.08	But my body is very comfortable today.
472.49	7.56	I guess I'm also just thinking about what, um...why does this machine make this sound?
480.72	3.82	Like what mechanism is making this sound?
498.61	3.34	Is it like magnetic fields clashing?
502.22	2.14	Or just the magnet moving?
506.97	3.11	I guess I should look that up.
534.22	6.91	Also, at the end of the machine I see these circular globe things.
541.45	1.63	I can't really see what it is.
543.13	3.22	It might be block or glass, or clear.
547.28	1.88	Just also wondering what that is.
