3.29	1.76	Oh, my God, that fucking sounds annoying.
8.71	1.26	At least the breeze is fine.
14.31	1.62	I won't be so dizzy when I stand up.
15.93	3.58	I feel like my fucking spatial orientation is so screwed up right now.
21.33	1.32	It's like I lay down and...
23.49	1.32	Actually, whatever.
32.53	3.42	I have to get my car and drive all the way back.
36.03	1.44	Oh, and I need to get gas.
37.77	12.8	I need to get gas, and I need to get back and study for fucking sub-live, and re-watch all those fucking lectures because I obviously didn't pay attention the first time through and I didn't even go to class, so that's not particularly helpful there.
54.67	2.18	I have so much fucking paramedic reading to do.
58.03	6.94	I should probably go to the gym today too because I didn't go yesterday, and four days out of seven is...
66.47	2.58	Yeah, too many rest days to account for that.
73.87	8.06	Oh shit, and if I'm going home this fucking weekend, then I won't be able to go to the gym then because I don't think I have my...
82.09	3.28	Yeah, nevermind, I do have that virtual fitness membership.
86.13	1.4	But it just sucks.
87.61	0.72	The gym sucks.
88.33	4.86	And there's no fat pad, so you can't bench press without fat pad.
95.93	4.4	Honestly, this is so more comfortable than the beds in Homewood are.
103.91	5.0	I could do without the beeping though, it's kind of not the vibe.
114.11	3.26	You know, if I pretend it's Death Grips, it's not that bad.
121.41	2.32	Now that I think about it, I feel like I've heard this before.
126.33	3.5	Left, yes, right, no, left, yes, right, no, left, yes, right, no.
143.89	1.84	I need to wash my car too.
149.25	1.76	I wonder if getting the detail would be expensive.
151.11	2.1	If I want to get the detail, and I want to get it tinted.
153.21	3.34	I wonder if I should get it tinted first, and then detail the detail first, and then tint it.
157.51	4.18	Probably the detail first, because if it's dirty, and they put the tints on, my prints are going to be fucked up.
163.59	1.7	Maybe when it gets warmer.
171.03	4.96	I'm not even worried about [salt] anymore, honestly, but I'll get the tints and try again.
185.25	8.08	I remember being worried about the tints when I got an old car, and then it got lost in a fight versus a semi so...
196.07	8.14	The mess of $50 tints probably would have been a lot better deal with than four weeks of phone calls in insurance companies.
206.17	2.46	Left, yes, right, no, left, yes, right, no.
215.01	2.44	I really hope I'm able to see this on my iPad.
217.79	2.12	That would be so fucking lame if I couldn't
221.93	3.46	And then Emily gets to see a scan of her brain, and I don't get to see a scan of my brain.
228.39	1.4	I need coffee.
230.69	0.93	Or an ashtray.
232.21	3.2	Or both.
244.87	2.68	It really does sound like a Death Grips song the more I listen to it.
248.59	4.64	The more I tune it out and treat it less like a sound and more like a song.
257.99	2.94	Is that Velcro?
265.81	3.56	I just feel like Velcro gets hated on unnecessarily.
270.79	4.62	Then again, yeah, lacing shoes is not my thing.
283.49	4.4	I don't like the fact that the darkness of the screen is different from the darkness of the barriers of the screen.
301.15	0.2	Tips for improvement.
301.83	7.66	I wonder if people setting this up had to listen to this entire audio file in its full length in order to make sure that the whole thing was exactly what they wanted it to be.
311.09	4.36	This mirror is all scratched up.
320.59	1.81	Scratches, no scratches.
322.4	1.23	Scratches, no scratches.
323.63	2.95	Scratches, no scratches.
328.89	2.09	Scratches.
339.55	3.68	This mirror is so crazy.
354.77	0.32	It's going to be warm when I go outside.
355.13	7.22	And then Thursday it's going to be warm too, but Thursday I'm fucking working all day, and then I have class in the afternoon, and then I have class in the evening too.
364.09	7.84	Maybe I'll sleep in way more after that, but initially I was going to Boston the next day and I'm going to New Jersey the next day.
382.97	0.12	Maybe I should.
383.33	2.16	You're going to need to turn up for a reason, didn't I?
390.59	2.04	I think today is bench day, right?
394.4	3.8	Because yesterday I did nothing, the day before that I did legs.
398.21	2.26	That was before the formal.
404.67	3.2	There's no way it hasn't been fucking ten minutes already.
412.87	1.12	I wish I had a watch.
414.89	1.49	No, watches probably have metal in them.
417.7	1.45	That would be very helpful.
422.67	4.78	I mean, Casio watches probably have metal too.
438.99	3.64	I'm getting the feeling that the sound is supposed to make it harder for me to think.
447.41	2.22	Yeah, well, thinking is hard anyway, so...
450.94	2.09	Jokes on that.
461.59	4.52	I hope my brain is hot.
472.03	1.62	I could go for pizza.
475.31	3.66	I could put a coal- honestly, fuck it, I might as well put a coal fire.
483.01	3.54	No. I need to pay off my card.
488.59	3.34	I don't get why the dining hall food has to fucking suck.
491.93	1.48	Like I just don't understand it.
497.23	6.58	And it's like, Maryland- I would love to stay in Maryland, but I just would also like to have good access to food.
503.93	3.12	And it's just, I don't know what it is about this particular area, but...
508.01	1.51	Like good lettuce.
509.52	2.22	Why is it so hard to get good fucking lettuce?
512.55	0.87	Or strawberries.
513.42	1.97	Like, come on.
523.13	2.49	I'm starting to get really annoyed at that cross on the screen.
525.62	3.07	I'm going to have people move.
533.59	1.42	Can I see myself from there?
535.01	1.18	No, I can't.
536.38	0.4	Maybe?
537.23	0.82	Is that my shoulder?
538.49	0.96	I don't know.
541.99	4.26	My fucking eye itches.
548.49	3.5	Thank God I don't have to sneeze.
553.09	3.42	That's going to happen, probably.
560.6	1.12	That'd be fun.
564.25	1.46	That'd be some fun clean-up, though.
579.33	2.66	I need to fix my Google Calendar.
583.15	3.12	I feel like I'm not really liking the color scheme anymore.
588.59	2.38	I can do pastel colors on, since spring's coming.
590.97	0.98	Yeah, I think that'd be nice.
592.09	5.2	No, but pastel colors don't make things seem important, so...
