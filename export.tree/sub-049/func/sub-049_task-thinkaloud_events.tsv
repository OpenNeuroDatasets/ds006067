15.32	0.8	Can I start?
23.74	1.8	I can't wait to go home.
25.8	0.96	I'm so tired.
27.57	3.58	I still have to take the research methods exam and I hope I do well.
32.6	6.88	I wonder if it's gonna be cold because I hate walking back from Gilman when it's cold 'cause it's such a long walk back to my dorm.
40.35	5.65	At least I have a good jacket, so I don't think I'll be too cold, but then I wouldn't have time to eat when I get back,
46.15	1.86	and I have to study for psycho on Wednesday.
48.93	1.51	I hope I get enough sleep.
51.71	4.3	But it's been really hard me to fall asleep lately, I think I've just messed up my sleep schedule.
56.71	4.32	But then I know I'm gonna end up watching Netflix and I just…
61.26	7.5	I don't know, I think there's a new show that I might want to watch, but I feel like I've been watching too many shows, which is not good because I know I need to study.
69.09	9.35	But I feel like starting a new show isn't the best, but I know that the show that I wanna watch probably will be really good and give me a break.
79.05	3.35	But I know I should probably start reading because I do have a few books.
83.33	2.18	I also need to water my plants before I leave.
85.64	1.99	Actually, I need to make sure that I pack them.
88.79	6.92	I don't know if I'm gonna be able to actually bring them with me, because if I'm flying back home, I don't think I can bring them on the plane.
95.8	5.34	But I also can't leave them in my dorm because then it's gonna be too long without being watered.
101.86	6.49	I feel like maybe I could give them to Grace, but I don't know if Grace is gonna wanna water my plants for four weeks.
108.86	4.9	But I also don't think I trust them to water my plants because I think they would end up forgetting about them.
115.07	11.12	But I feel like at the same time, I could leave them and they would be okay, because they're succulents, so they're not really supposed to do well with like constant watering.
126.91	4.12	And I think they'd be better if I just left them alone anyway, but we'll see.
131.93	12.03	I think I actually will get a couple more plants when I go home, just so my room is a little bit more green and not as depressing as it always is, but we'll have to see because…
145.37	8.13	I mean, I should go out when I go home, I don't really know where I'm gonna go, but I don't know, maybe Target 'cause I like shopping at Target.
154.46	5.12	And if I could just ask my dad for money, I'm sure I could make some purchases.
160.46	10.29	But at the same time, I don't really wanna run into people from my high school at Target, because that's gonna start a whole other story that I don't really wanna get into, but maybe…
170.87	2.2	Actually will I have to stop by my high school?
173.2	4.43	I don't think so, because if David isn't gonna need a ride to school…
178.37	4.38	I mean, if he has practice but he doesn't have practice 'cause he's done with his season.
182.88	4.59	But I don't know if he's playing at winter school because if he is, I would have to give him a…
187.6	1.0	Give him a ride to home.
189.11	3.64	But I don't think he's playing any sports this season, so I think I should be fine.
193.48	6.83	And unless doesn't he notice, yeah, I don't really have to pick him up, so I think I should be able to avoid going back there.
201.46	10.19	But that means I also have to avoid going to this grocery store in my town because everyone likes to go there, but that means I'd have to drive 30 minutes and gas is expensive.
211.83	3.08	I don't wanna drive 30 minutes to the nearest Target.
215.53	5.53	So maybe I would just drive my dad's car, but I don't like my dad's car, it's not…
221.51	0.6	I don't like it.
222.66	4.62	I feel like, if he got a new car, I got to drive his car and I don't want that.
227.75	3.02	So maybe my mom can have his car and he gets a new car.
231.8	6.88	And I just stick with my car right now, but my car right now also has a lot of problems, I don't know if I even like it that much.
241.61	8.03	I mean, I do like it because it's my first car, but I feel like the amount of money that I spend on it is not worth it.
249.8	1.45	So maybe I should get a new car.
251.99	4.55	But I don't have the money for a new car, so maybe I should ask my dad.
257.29	7.06	I don't think he'd get me a car for my birthday 'cause that's kind of crazy, but I don't know what he would get me for my birthday, which is funny because…
265.02	2.03	I don't know, my birthday is in like six…
267.33	2.67	Yeah, it's in six months, so I should…
270.61	7.27	I don't actually have to start thinking about what I want for my birthday because six months is still a long time, but I don't know.
278.05	11.71	My birthday is on a Monday, so that's gonna be so terrible, and I'm gonna be here taking summer classes, I still can't believe that I made that decision, but I guess I don't really have a choice.
290.05	5.72	So I'm gonna be here on a Monday at class, and it's not gonna be fun.
296.98	10.04	I don't know what I'm gonna do, I don't know if anyone is gonna be down here to celebrate my birthday with me, but hopefully my parents come down because we always celebrate our birthday together.
307.8	11.12	But now I'm wondering if I would actually do anything because I usually would go out to eat, but none of my friends would be here, but I could hang out with Uche but I don't know if he…
319.05	6.08	I mean he's always working, but I'm sure he would take a day off to hang out with me for my birthday.
325.96	0.71	But I feel like…
327.14	3.74	I don't know, he's always trying to be weird, but we'll see.
332.2	4.23	It's gonna be really weird being here for the entire summer and not going home because…
337.12	4.52	I mean, I like being home, but if I'm home for too long, then it gets pretty tiring.
342.83	6.17	But I feel like if I'm here, I'm also gonna be sick of being here and not having anything to do because none of my friends are here.
349.71	6.19	Like I can't really go out to events and stuff if my friends aren't here, because I don't really like paying…
356.08	4.52	Paying for Lyfts and my friends usually pay for the Lyfts and I pay for the drinks.
360.85	0.96	So it's gonna be…
362.53	2.18	It's gonna be interesting to see how that goes.
365.26	4.24	I definitely do not think I would go out by myself because that's just not a good idea.
370.18	5.77	And I also don't think it would be that fun to go out by myself, unless it was like a day thing but not a night thing.
376.09	1.45	I would never go for a night thing by myself.
377.83	5.68	But I think I actually need to buy some more like going out clothes.
383.63	4.35	I don't have a lot and I don't really wanna re re-wear the same things.
388.99	7.99	'Cause if then I take pictures in those clothes, people are gonna know that I wear the same things, which I don't often but, I mean, I guess I kinda do.
398.42	5.47	I have a lot of clothes, but I always wear the same things, which is probably black, 'cause that's my favorite color.
404.0	0.74	I love wearing black.
405.64	9.76	"I don't think I ever wear any color, which is not good because I remember seeing a tweet that says that, ""You should embrace wearing other colors."""
415.92	2.13	And I also saw that on TikTok, which is really weird.
418.19	5.04	But I don't really plan on embracing any other colors because I don't really like them.
423.63	0.96	Maybe red or…
425.22	0.69	No, I don't like red.
426.31	2.38	Um, I guess yellow.
428.96	0.13	No.
429.28	1.25	I mean yellow does…
430.93	2.61	It's supposed to look good on my skin tone, but I don't…
434.08	1.32	I feel like it's too bubbly for me.
435.64	1.15	I don't like being bubbly.
437.4	6.44	So I think maybe I would try green, but like, not dark green, sage green, like an emerald green.
444.42	3.73	'Cause I know that I want my wedding colors to be emerald green and the…
448.3	3.29	I don't know, emerald green, I mean and silver, I don't know.
451.81	3.39	That's a really long time away to be thinking about that.
455.87	2.95	I know it will be some sort of emerald green kind of thing.
459.33	6.96	Um, I mean I can't really think about a wedding because I don't even have a boyfriend, so that's a dumb thing to think about.
466.82	1.69	But we'll see how that goes.
468.91	3.12	Um, yeah, I'm tired.
472.9	0.9	I'm not even tired.
473.95	1.36	I say that a lot.
475.99	0.7	I feel like I get a…
477.02	1.38	A lot of sleep, than…
478.83	1.05	Compared to other people.
480.62	10.16	I feel like I value my sleep a lot and I don't care how much work I have to do the next day, if I have to sleep, I have to sleep, that's, that's just how it's gonna be.
491.71	10.53	I guess, I've chosen sleep over a lot of things, which is not good, because I have definitely regretted, like I should have stayed up last night to study 'cause I wasn't even tired.
502.64	12.42	I don't know why I was trying to go to sleep at 1:00 AM when I wasn't tired and I didn't end up falling asleep until like 5:00 AM, which was so dumb because I just ended up staying on my phone and on TikTok, I don't know why.
515.43	0.64	I think I have an…
516.56	1.36	An addiction to TikTok.
518.72	4.56	But it's just gonna get worse when I go home because I'm gonna have nothing to do.
523.99	3.09	I don't think I'm gonna even work because I was supposed to apply to a…
527.3	0.72	For some jobs.
528.15	2.74	But like, I don't even wanna work because…
532.5	5.34	I feel like every place I'd wanna work, I've either worked there before or I just don't wanna go back there.
537.97	2.31	And I feel like I would just see people that I know.
541.04	4.29	Which is, it kinda of sucks living in a small town because like you cannot avoid people.
545.72	2.11	Like you're bound to see people wherever you go, which sucks.
549.21	2.84	I feel like I've seen some people that I don't wanna see.
552.72	0.84	Especially at the gym.
554.14	1.61	I don't go to the gym, I don't know why.
556.7	1.29	Actually, I know why, 'cause I'm lazy.
558.15	0.86	I don't like working out.
560.53	3.33	Yeah, I don't think I'll be at the gym, even though it's like two minutes from my house.
564.51	2.28	So I could even walk there but it's cold.
567.53	1.91	Yeah, it's even colder than it is down here.
569.67	1.83	So yeah, I will not be going there.
572.02	6.37	But I will try and have some healthy habits for my new year's resolutions and we'll see how that goes.
580.29	3.42	I mean, we'll see if I'm able to actually stick with them this year.
584.38	1.89	I think I stuck with my resolutions last year.
588.0	5.29	Oh wait, I think last year I said that I wouldn't make any resolutions because I feel like they are just stupid.
593.7	1.02	Yeah, I definitely said that.
594.83	0.97	That's something that I would say.
596.21	1.57	So I don't think I will be doing any…
598.1	0.42	Actually, no, I…
598.62	0.9	I'm doing something this year.
600.0	0.43	I'm going…
