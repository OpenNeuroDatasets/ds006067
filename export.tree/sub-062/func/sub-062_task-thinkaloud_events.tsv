3.65	1.91	My face itches a little bit.
6.75	1.67	Around my nose and my eyes and...
8.82	7.49	I kept thinking that it's ironic that you only feel these kinds of things when you're not supposed to move, so...
19.47	4.27	And the other thing is that I was kind of thinking that I wasn't...
24.63	5.46	I was reading a paper on the bus and I forgot that I'm a little bit claustrophobic, so...
32.07	2.0	It's kind of a blessing that the mirror is here.
36.68	3.39	And I can see the screen, otherwise I would kind of have to keep my eyes shut.
44.87	3.88	And it made me feel a little bit anxious the first time I got inside.
51.49	1.38	And the itching is still there.
57.55	2.08	I remember I passed by the office...
62.15	6.71	Where I brought a lamp with me that I fixed just before I left from home.
71.41	2.17	Which for some reason after the trip didn't work.
76.59	6.07	And I was thinking that I should go and get some light bulbs from a hardware store, maybe the light is the problem.
87.29	5.22	Now I feel a kind of a strange heat around my head.
95.22	2.45	And this noise is really loud.
103.49	3.74	Yeah, I was just thinking what I have to do when I leave.
109.64	0.93	I have a class at 1.
113.45	2.13	Then I'm pretty free for the rest of the day.
116.61	1.75	I remember that I went to the gym yesterday.
119.49	3.64	In the evening I haven't been climbing since I was home for about 6 weeks.
128.22	1.73	It's just fun, I went with a bunch of friends.
131.78	0.81	We had a great time.
136.86	5.83	Then I remember that I got back home and I went straight to sleep because I'm still a little bit jet lagged.
145.46	1.81	This morning too I woke up around 6.
148.62	3.63	When it's still dark and it's kind of strange because there's...
155.5	3.11	No one on the streets or at the university.
164.76	3.15	Thinking of the university I remembered of some colleagues we used to have a...
172.39	4.56	Kind of a group where we used to play some games.
185.88	3.89	I should go practice a little bit because I'm going to have...
192.83	1.95	the audition for the chamber music stuff.
197.02	3.81	And I'm just thinking I did some of that back home but...
202.93	1.68	I haven't played piano in a couple of weeks.
209.74	1.39	Which kind of reminds me of work.
218.42	2.31	I just have a long list of stuff that I have to read and do.
223.21	3.18	Which reminds me of the Baby Lab and we're going to have...
228.93	3.77	Some interviews, some people interviewing for graduate school.
235.48	6.25	Which is kind of exciting because I feel that there's very few of us in the Vision Lab and in the Baby Lab.
244.7	4.39	It would be nice to kind of grow the community and have more colleagues and...
250.49	5.32	Just people with similar interests to talk to and maybe do some projects together.
262.89	8.8	Which reminds me of some of the friends that I made here and I was kind of looking forward to coming back and seeing them.
275.17	2.4	Especially some of them that I've seen on Sunday, I had a great time.
285.83	1.17	I just realized that the...
288.29	3.02	Kind of being lost inside my head, the itching went away.
292.07	1.95	But now that I remember it, of course it came back.
302.14	4.78	Talking of friends, I remember my trip back home.
306.96	4.34	I was just looking at some pictures in the morning.
313.74	2.33	It's just some visual images that came back from...
319.31	2.09	I went hiking on a mountain, for example, with a friend.
323.59	2.16	There are these gorgeous scenes from the top of the mountain.
325.8	2.01	There's snow all around and there's sun.
331.24	4.78	A bunch of cliffs and pine trees.
336.05	0.91	It was really nice.
337.63	1.1	I remember that...
339.83	7.36	I think because it was snowing during the week, it was just the two of us in the mountain and we kept seeing all kinds of tracks.
348.95	5.65	At some point we got a little bit scared that maybe some wild animals are going to roam around.
354.99	2.62	I don't think there was anyone inside for maybe hours.
362.26	1.64	Which just reminded me that...
368.38	1.4	I have a car back home that I...
372.73	2.23	I guess I didn't really have enough time to sell when I was back.
376.85	1.19	I left it to a friend.
378.18	1.6	I have to change the ad.
381.87	3.16	I guess I still had a couple of things to do that I maybe didn't intend to.
388.53	1.41	Which just reminded me of him.
392.81	3.55	When I was home I looked at a bunch of pictures since I was a kid.
397.9	1.95	And I've known him since I was seven.
403.05	1.63	And I particularly remember...
407.92	2.73	Some pictures of us from around then.
410.67	1.1	I think we were in the first grade.
413.71	5.87	And he just had a very sweet face of a kid.
422.77	2.52	And it reminded me of another funny story with cookies.
430.31	3.15	And then some later pictures since when we were in high school.
436.39	7.38	And both he and I lost a lot of the pictures that we had because they were on computers and the disks got broken.
447.87	3.51	We're kind of thinking of asking other colleagues and centralize whatever we have.
454.21	1.4	Which reminded me of...
459.5	1.39	He just moved into a new place.
462.68	6.83	It's outside of a town in a village but it's a really nice place where you can kind of see a mountain close by.
470.53	6.63	And I just have the picture in my mind sitting in his house on the couch just looking around.
478.02	0.88	It was really gorgeous.
485.54	8.57	The whole feeling of being home is still really fresh in my mind and it seems like a completely different world.
494.76	3.26	It's almost as if you watch a TV show and then you change to another one.
498.41	1.9	It's a completely different story, a different setting.
501.0	0.74	Nothing is the same.
509.71	10.54	And I just have a bunch of, I don't know, pictures of streets and friends and places that come to mind.
522.13	3.25	Some people I've known for maybe like 25 years.
527.6	1.51	And I just remember that I went...
529.95	5.02	I also went to the city where I used to live for the past 15 years.
535.0	2.68	It's not where my mom lives or where I was born.
539.23	4.18	And one night we went to a concert with a lot of my old friends.
543.77	1.86	Maybe there were like 15 people there.
547.44	7.08	And again, it's just like a very vivid but mostly like image.
558.58	4.46	Just kind of like standing together and talking and having a good time.
563.07	3.93	And I remember the music a little bit as well.
567.07	9.0	It was a tribute band that plays music of Pink Floyd.
577.82	1.18	Which all of us kind of like.
582.97	0.5	And I just...
584.65	5.68	I can still remember a little bit the voice of the female singer.
591.67	1.39	She almost had this kind of...
595.37	3.08	a little bit of like an opera-like voice.
598.49	2.7	And there were a lot of songs that I have a ...
