3.34	2.8	So yeah, I got back home.
6.26	3.56	I got back to college from home this Sunday.
10.3	7.74	I went to home for, I went to India for about a month where I got to meet my family and also my sister.
18.46	2.64	I have a twin sister who just graduated.
21.7	5.96	And so, she graduated a semester early and so now she's at home, and she's going to be starting her job soon.
27.76	3.72	So, we all just got to like get together and celebrate her graduation.
32.4	5.12	We ended up going to Thailand to celebrate it and that was like a surprise trip for her.
37.84	1.42	And it was really, really nice.
39.34	2.58	I actually loved the place and the people there.
43.1	2.6	And there was also like a lot of shopping to do that I love.
46.42	20.7	And then we got back from there and I had a few days left before like I had to come back to college, which was honestly a little bittersweet because I was so excited to see my friends after such a long time, but also really sad to leave home, especially because my sister was at home and she was going to stay for a couple of more days.
68.76	3.3	And she lives in California, so I don't get to see her that often.
72.7	10.32	But yeah, since I've been back, it's been, and like I got back on Sunday, so I didn't really get a lot of time to settle in because classes started on Monday.
83.42	4.04	Thankfully, I had like a late class on Monday at 4.30.
87.7	10.98	And so, I got like some time to unpack and look at my schedule and stuff like that, and like meet my friends one time before we all started our busy semester.
99.66	9.46	But yeah, I think the first week is generally like pretty busy or hectic, I would say, because we're all like trying out classes.
110.4	5.78	But I'm like taking a class called deep learning, which I've been wanting to take since a really, really long time.
116.18	3.26	And I ended up like trying that class out and I liked it.
119.48	5.46	And then I was supposed to like take another class called human-robot interaction.
126.12	4.72	And I went to attend that class, but I didn't really like the vibes that much.
131.26	6.48	There was a lot of like in-class work that had to be done, which I wasn't a huge fan of.
138.2	3.82	I like being at home and just doing work at home.
142.5	3.18	So, I didn't really like it.
146.02	4.22	But there was another class that I tried out, which was called sketching and indexing.
150.24	7.72	And that class was being taught by Benjamin Lambead, who's actually my faculty advisor.
158.52	1.25	And he's just so amazing.
159.77	12.99	And so, I got to take his class for the first time ever in four years, which is so ironic because every semester whenever I meet him for my advising meeting, I tell him that, oh, you know, like he teaches two classes.
172.76	2.16	One of them is called sketching and indexing.
175.3	3.45	And the other one is called computational genomics, I think.
178.75	6.41	And I always tell him that, oh, I'm like planning on taking your class, but I'll try it out and see if like another class works for me.
185.62	1.94	And I never end up taking it.
187.8	5.24	But this semester, I think I like that class more than the other class that I was actually planning on taking.
194.16	1.92	So, I'm going to take sketching and indexing.
196.4	8.6	And it's just such an interesting topic and something that is not cliche at all, like machine learning, AI is something that we hear about every day.
205.0	17.82	But this course is about how data is structured, and how like we compress it and index it such that it can be shared like in a faster manner or scale so that it takes lesser time to like compute on it.
222.96	2.02	Like it makes the whole process more efficient.
225.52	7.98	And it's honestly like something that's not talked about that much in like the exact manner that we talked about in that class.
233.6	3.42	And so, I'm really excited to learn a lot of new things.
237.56	9.92	And the class is actually based on data structures, contrary to like what you would naturally tend to think about.
247.71	8.17	Like you would think that there will be like many advanced topics, but we're actually just like starting out with hash tables and hash sets, which is like basic data structure.
255.92	2.76	So, I'm really excited about taking that class.
259.58	5.18	And yeah, I'm excited to do, this is my last semester.
264.8	2.38	So, there're some things that I've like wanted to do.
267.5	3.24	There's a lot of restaurants on my list that I've yet to try.
271.26	8.33	And also, I want to do ice skating, because I used to do like speed skating as a child.
279.59	5.61	I did it from like the age of five till I was in high school or till the time I ended high school.
285.22	2.02	So, like till the last year of high school.
288.8	8.38	And it was like such a great experience for me, because I think the group that I practiced with was like the best part.
298.08	4.04	And the reason why I have so many memories from like being a part of the sport.
302.9	7.56	Every year we used to like travel about like four to five times to different states in India to participate in competitions.
310.64	8.8	And we all used to travel together and also be there at the competition together, obviously, like in our different age groups and races.
319.5	4.12	And so, it was such a great bonding experience for all of us.
323.64	4.0	All of our families were really good friends, and we were really good friends with each other.
327.84	4.58	And it was just like such an amazing thing for me.
333.0	1.06	And I miss it a lot.
334.16	18.46	And so, like being able to do ice skating here is such a great way to relive some of those times, even though I'm like not that good at ice skating when compared to like speed skating, because in ice skating, like you have to skate on a blade versus like wheels.
352.62	2.28	But nevertheless, I'm like really excited.
355.6	3.04	And then it's also getting like really cold here.
359.58	2.7	But most of the cold is like associated with the wind.
362.56	3.54	And so that's sometimes a little bit of a bugger.
367.14	1.22	But I'm waiting for it to snow.
368.4	4.23	I was checking the weather, and it's supposed to snow on Thursday.
372.63	4.75	So, I'm really, really hoping that we get to see some snow.
377.56	6.1	Because last year actually was a really good year because I think there was like a lot of snow.
384.0	7.2	Well, not that much like you would expect to see in Chicago, but it was enough snow to be able to like stay for a couple of days.
392.5	1.82	And so, I got to take a few pictures.
395.22	6.28	I still remember like my freshman year when I experienced snow for the first time, it was a surreal experience.
402.04	7.36	And so, I'm really hoping that we get to see some snow because it's my last year here and I'll probably move to the West Coast after this.
410.04	3.1	My sister lives in California and she's going to stay there.
413.14	4.9	And I'll also be moving to California because both of our jobs are going to be there.
418.76	3.02	So, it's going to be a long time before I come to the East Coast.
422.58	3.06	So really hoping to see some snow.
426.94	5.57	And yeah, like apart from that, as I said, my sister is still home.
432.51	8.77	There's like a really nice movie that just came out and she went out to watch it with my parents, and I'll probably watch it here.
441.64	2.8	Hopefully, it'll come out on some OTT platform.
445.08	11.22	It's a huge movie, so I'm hoping that they'll release it in the theater here because they don't do it with like all international movies.
457.54	5.78	But I'll like go back today and check if that movie has been released or not.
464.5	4.78	Also this semester, wanting to like cook more than I usually do.
469.68	6.82	I actually tried making overnight oats last night and they turned out to be so great.
477.32	3.6	It's the kind of breakfast that I can eat every single day.
482.02	2.2	It was also really easy to make.
484.22	9.94	Just had to put equal quantities of oats and milk and then half of that quantity of like Greek yogurt, and then you can top it off with anything you want.
494.18	1.96	And you can also put like flax seeds in there.
496.32	3.52	It's like really good, really good source of fiber.
500.74	6.44	And I prepared it last night and I tried it this morning and I was blown away.
507.24	7.5	Especially given how easy it was to make, like you don't need to do any cooking and it's still so tasty.
514.84	1.26	So, I'm really excited to.
516.37	8.09	Milk and cereal is something that I can eat every single day and it's the reason why I look forward to waking up because I love milk and cereal.
525.44	10.32	But cereal has sugar and it might not be as healthy, but I'm hoping that overnight oats will be healthier than cereal, and they taste as good.
536.18	3.64	So, I am excited to keep eating them throughout the semester.
540.24	5.58	And I got a lot of food from home, like things to prepare.
545.82	6.84	So, we'll see if I'm able to make all of that food.
554.08	6.3	But yeah, apart from that, I'm excited to be a part of this study again.
560.96	3.46	I recently participated in another study and it was a great experience.
565.0	3.68	So, I'm excited to see what comes out of this study.
569.26	2.68	And hopefully it all goes well.
573.82	4.28	Another thing is that there's a lot of things to plan for this semester.
578.44	4.5	I have to like apply for my OPT, which is basically like a work permit.
584.22	3.42	So, I've been dealing with that.
588.22	2.58	You can like only apply three months before graduation.
591.6	4.51	And so, there're a lot of like things that you have to keep in mind, and like a timeline that you have to go with.
596.29	3.29	And also, ensure that you apply like as soon as possible because...
