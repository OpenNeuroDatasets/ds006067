5.06	6.34	This sound is really interesting, but I always feel like it's pretty comfortable in the MRI machine.
11.44	2.16	I didn't expect it to be this comfortable.
13.94	4.9	I feel like I could maybe go to sleep without the noise.
18.84	4.96	I don't know if it's because I'm tired, but it's really nice.
25.34	4.98	I thought I'd be more claustrophobic or afraid of being in here, but it's actually not too bad.
32.08	4.98	I guess I just like being in small, confined spaces where it's warm and not...
37.54	1.46	I don't know if it's actually that warm.
39.86	1.56	I think it's kind of warm.
44.24	4.08	I guess my arms are kind of cold, but I'm kind of too scared to move my arms around right now.
49.22	1.52	But I don't know, it's not too bad.
51.19	1.55	At least my stomach's warm.
55.52	2.4	This sounds kind of interesting.
58.54	4.2	But honestly, I feel like because I'm such a deep sleeper, I probably could go to sleep.
65.08	2.59	I'm a little keen to notice about moving my head.
67.67	10.67	I don't think I'm moving my head, but I feel like I'm kind of over-aware of the fact that whenever I move my mouth to talk or to blink, my head is moving.
79.9	1.14	But I don't think it's actually moving.
81.06	2.9	I don't know if it's just anxiety or if it actually is moving.
84.52	5.48	But also, there's no way to do this without moving my head or not moving my head or by not moving my mouth.
91.14	1.6	I feel like I'm just invading myself.
93.18	2.9	But oh, well, I think it is what it is.
97.9	4.12	Yeah, I think this is an experience.
103.2	3.06	I'm excited to talk to Dr. Berman about this.
108.12	2.24	I don't know if all MRIs are kind of this loud.
110.36	0.98	It probably is all this loud.
111.42	1.48	I'm really excited to get brain scans.
112.9	1.18	I think it'll be one of...
114.3	1.34	I hope they don't find anything.
116.98	0.78	That would be pretty bad.
117.86	1.48	But I think...
119.76	1.02	I hope they get the brain scans.
120.94	0.86	That would be cool to look at.
122.16	2.42	Although, it's not like I would know what to do with them even after I get them.
126.78	4.64	I mean, maybe if the future where we get another MRI scan, we can compare and that would be kind of cool.
131.94	2.64	I don't know if my chest really would change.
134.58	3.38	I mean, hopefully, unless I don't have any pathology, which would be really...
138.16	0.91	That would be good.
139.07	0.93	That's what we're hoping for.
140.12	1.1	But yeah, I think...
142.3	0.7	That's all good.
143.86	1.4	Yeah, I don't know.
147.94	2.1	I can't describe what the sound is like.
150.04	2.26	It's like I'm inside a big printer.
152.66	2.74	It's like all the little sounds of the printer would just magnify.
155.6	2.14	Now it's literally inside the machine right now.
160.52	1.34	That's wild.
165.86	2.34	I was hoping that Misha didn't have to go into lab today.
168.68	1.46	Or I think she is going into lab.
171.06	3.88	But I guess she said that Nate was sending her a new list of the new post-grads coming in.
175.22	1.2	So that's cool.
176.94	1.64	I don't think that Rafa is actually upset with her.
178.58	1.1	I think it's just...
180.26	2.86	He probably wants to ask her her thoughts about the new post-grad system.
183.66	2.14	I don't know what it means that I never got asked to do that.
185.82	3.14	But I think it's probably fun, and plus I don't think I have anything good to say.
189.02	2.04	So, I think it would all...
191.06	0.84	I think it all works.
191.9	5.36	I don't think she would have a huge amount of really great things to say either.
197.3	2.38	And she's probably just going to be straight up about it all.
199.74	1.26	But I don't know.
201.64	3.4	I definitely don't think that her meeting with her on Monday is going to be anything bad.
205.56	2.84	Especially since the text message was not...
209.1	3.56	It didn't seem like he was that upset necessarily.
212.82	4.91	Or like he was going to...
218.29	3.99	He wanted to be upset or scold her or do anything like that to her.
222.44	2.24	So, I think if that's not, it will be all good.
227.2	5.03	I think it just kind of fits the survivor's guilt or just being able to leave, but then having people escape.
232.23	4.29	But also I think that in the end I guess we all make decisions.
237.66	4.96	We all make decisions we want or are willing to tolerate and live with.
244.76	3.63	I just wish that she didn't...
249.34	2.52	Or they all didn't have to stay there.
253.38	0.76	But I guess...
254.88	5.48	I mean, I do hope that they get a publisher paper or whatever they want to do with that.
261.62	3.74	Or at least because they work so hard and it will be...
270.79	6.39	I think for her it's something that would make the experience worthwhile.
277.92	2.28	I mean I guess I really wanted that but...
283.5	2.48	I know it's not happening so I'm more resigned.
285.98	4.1	I guess I'm just resigned about a lot of things in life right now.
290.44	1.7	Like not being accepted to different places.
292.44	0.6	But I think it's fine.
293.04	1.98	I think I'll be happy no matter where I end up.
297.58	1.47	I guess I was kind of thinking about this yesterday.
299.05	10.87	But I don't want my own time or my own experiences to be made worthwhile, not by things that are determined by other people.
309.94	9.66	Or by things that I can't control like publications or approval from other people because I just can't control that.
321.84	2.88	I think for her and for Ethan and Sarah...
328.64	1.44	Maybe it's because they work more.
330.82	4.18	And they're more invested in what they do, and I'm kind of more just burnt out.
335.0	3.11	And I don't care too much anymore, and I just want to leave.
339.25	1.69	And I'm leaving soon in a few weeks.
341.12	1.84	So, then for me I don't...
342.96	2.18	There's no chance of anything ever positive happening.
346.56	2.78	But maybe for them they still have some hope and I hope that it works out.
350.18	2.62	I guess a part of me is sort of jealous and envious of that.
352.86	1.9	But also another part of me I guess...
355.48	1.92	I'd much prefer taking my acceptance and leaving.
357.5	5.28	Than having this possibility of being published or whatever.
364.52	0.89	In this place.
368.24	5.16	I'm sure that I'll be able to work really hard and make something work in the long run somewhere else.
373.62	4.7	Where I don't have to constantly feel like someone is going to attack me or hurt me.
380.2	5.2	Or hold things like publications or papers or conferences or whatever.
386.02	1.76	Financial things over my head.
389.38	1.74	I'm really excited to not have to deal with that anymore.
391.12	1.05	I'm really excited that...
393.93	2.15	I guess it's really nice how the trees are flowering now.
396.2	2.63	And I hope that whenever I get to meet Juliet maybe...
400.44	0.79	What is it?
401.23	0.65	Like April 1st.
405.63	1.26	Yeah, I guess the beginning of April.
406.89	1.05	So, I think it's March.
408.3	0.68	I'll be able to hang out.
409.72	1.26	My arm kind of hurts.
410.98	0.82	My arm.
412.6	1.19	I guess like the weird...
414.33	0.85	Sudden movement.
415.26	0.43	Don't...
415.69	0.45	Joint...
416.14	1.14	I felt weird.
417.88	1.12	I don't know if I moved my arm.
419.0	1.66	I should ask them if I can move my arm.
425.16	0.98	No, I probably can't scratch.
426.46	0.4	I don't know.
429.23	1.05	Oh, yes, I'm excited.
430.64	3.62	I don't know if I should ask them if we should go to D.C.
436.57	0.73	Amy's really...
437.3	1.46	Seems really cool.
439.16	1.23	But I just...
441.56	3.78	Maybe it would be kind of a lot to have both of them and they haven't met each other before.
445.56	1.58	And I haven't met Amy before.
448.02	1.32	So, all hang out together.
450.12	0.86	Like kind of far away.
452.72	2.68	I mean I think that it's going to work out.
456.14	1.26	In terms of like just hanging out.
457.56	1.84	I just don't know if I'm hanging out in a new city.
459.88	0.82	Very far away.
461.56	0.76	Relatively.
462.74	1.62	Compared to just staying in Baltimore.
464.44	0.68	But I don't know.
465.64	1.22	But I'm still excited to go.
466.92	0.68	And I think...
468.41	0.85	Hopefully, I don't...
470.48	0.92	I'm kind of worried.
471.74	4.66	Since Julia doesn't have a great experience here.
476.88	1.52	Whereas I think Amy is really good.
478.56	2.6	But I think it's also different because she's in a different school.
481.52	0.48	I don't know.
484.55	1.11	I hope they'll work.
487.63	3.51	I think that they'll be able to be friends.
491.54	0.5	Hopefully.
492.28	1.12	It'll be really great if they can be friends.
493.66	3.31	Because even if I'm not there they can still hang out.
496.97	2.27	And also I think I've...
500.46	3.56	I know that it's being part of grad school experience.
504.2	1.34	Or grad school...
507.64	1.14	Yeah, grad school experience.
508.86	1.12	To be more isolated.
510.06	5.08	Compared to like undergrad or like a school kind of class environment.
516.1	0.91	But I just don't...
517.97	1.99	I still don't want that for Julia.
520.04	0.97	Because I don't think...
522.32	1.6	I think that's kind of hard to go through.
523.94	3.86	When grad school is already so difficult and her lab is already a mess.
530.84	3.48	I mean, maybe she'd have mixed feelings of being close to someone from the same school.
534.5	0.55	But she's...
535.05	4.99	One of the reasons she's having a really great experience is she's having a kind of trash experience.
543.66	3.78	Hopefully, they can find things that they like and they can hang out and be friends.
547.92	0.86	That'll be good.
548.94	1.34	I mean, I guess for right now...
551.28	3.74	I mean, I'm planning on staying in Baltimore for another, what, like 10 years?
556.68	1.62	Or 8 years minimum.
558.52	2.26	So, in that situation I mean...
561.42	1.12	I'll be here but...
564.5	1.6	Part of me just wants to go back to New York.
568.92	1.78	Baltimore doesn't really...
570.86	0.79	It's fine.
572.22	0.66	It's fine.
573.32	0.6	It's fine.
574.82	0.88	Maybe I should...
577.22	0.77	It's fine.
577.99	1.99	But I think a part of me just...
579.98	1.32	I really want to go back to New York.
581.58	0.9	And I guess whenever...
583.48	3.54	I know that Rachel and Sarah, and Joyce, and like everyone is back.
587.2	1.26	And then I could go...
589.16	3.6	It'll be like an hour and a half up north just to go to Poughkeepsie.
592.82	2.1	So then that wouldn't be so bad either.
595.82	0.68	I don't know.
596.5	0.9	New York really is a dream.
598.9	2.77	I mean, if I'm in Baltimore at least I can be...
