4.29	1.84	So I had a rough week this week.
6.33	7.9	It was the week before spring break and I think every now, all of my classes are starting to have midterms,
14.7	3.65	and we had a lot of assignments like all together.
18.64	10.84	And I also had to go to my lab and also do research, so I think this week was one of the toughest weeks that I had since I ever came here.
31.49	4.84	So, I had three midterms in a row for three of my classes.
36.43	11.24	One was a neural class, the other was a class for probability and statistics, and the last one was a public health course.
48.29	7.28	And I think I was a little bit overwhelmed while trying to prepare for all these three exams at once.
56.07	3.69	And because they were like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
60.79	3.57	My neuro exam was on Tuesday.
65.4	1.3	It wasn't too bad.
66.74	7.23	I think I was well prepared for it, so I haven't got back the results yet, but I'm not too worried about it.
74.5	3.17	I studied like a couple of them last week.
77.93	5.63	I spent some time studying for it, so I should be okay with that exam.
83.84	4.13	But I'm not sure if I did too well on my stats exam.
89.21	10.16	I did use a couple of days to study for it, and it was right after the day I took my neuro exam, so I was a little bit already tired.
99.49	5.28	So, I just had to keep studying after I finished my neuro exam.
106.64	4.57	The test wasn't too bad, but I don't think I did too well.
111.34	13.04	There were a couple of questions I didn't expect, and a couple of problems that I don't think was covered too much, or like the professor didn't focus on it too much in class.
125.13	7.94	But I think I wasn't the only one who did too bad when I talked about it with my friends.
134.23	4.76	They weren't too happy about their performance in the test as well.
139.37	4.19	So, I'll just have to see what I got in that class, but...
144.07	4.73	And I think my last exam was on Thursday.
149.06	8.12	It was a class called Fundamentals of Public Health and Fundamentals of Public Health Policy and Management.
159.37	9.61	I think the exam was, it was the first exam of the semester, so nobody really knew what to expect from the exam.
169.5	8.71	Nobody really knew the formatting or the difficulty, or how the how much of the content we had to memorize or anything like that.
178.75	16.29	But the professor made an open note like two days before the exam, so we had some programming to do, but I made my notes and I think it actually helped a lot in the exam.
195.78	9.4	It wasn't like straight off, I couldn't find the answers to the MCQs straight off of my notes, but definitely it helped that it was open notes.
205.74	17.03	And it was a little bit of a time crunch because we had 50 minutes for 30 MCQs and two free response questions, so I had like five or ten minutes to go over my questions and kind of double check.
223.11	2.67	So, it was a little bit of a time crunch based exam,
228.02	6.54	but the class is known for not being too much of a burden.
234.7	4.13	It should be okay, and the grading scale is also pretty lenient.
238.95	2.93	So, I should also be okay with that exam.
242.64	1.09	So I did.
245.12	0.61	I'm really happ...
245.88	8.98	I was really happy last night that I was done with the exams and the first season, kind of season of midterms were over.
255.89	21.25	And so, last...but after my exams, my suite mates and I we all went out for dinner to kind of, not celebrate, but just to eat out at a nice restaurant to celebrate the finish of our first midterm week.
277.91	6.67	And it was really nice, it was a place called, somewhere in Inner Harbor.
284.61	4.4	I don't really remember the name of the place, but it was really good.
290.48	11.21	Because we were all really busy, and we had a lot of homework, and we had a lot of assignments going on throughout the week, and we didn't really have time to spend much time together.
302.88	4.07	But yesterday- so Friday night- was really nice.
307.3	7.69	We just got together after a hard week, and I think we really needed that time.
316.81	6.51	And so, today was also one of my roommate's birthday.
325.47	3.31	We also plan to head out either today or tomorrow.
328.86	2.97	I'm not really sure when, but we still need to talk things out.
332.68	8.99	But yeah, this week was a little bit tough, but I think it was- I'm happy that I got through it well.
342.39	4.1	And I still have a couple of assignments to finish off.
346.79	5.37	I have my linear algebra homework.
352.76	2.42	I also have a project for that class.
356.18	1.68	I haven't started on it,
358.28	3.2	but I should get started on that soon.
364.37	2.37	But I'm really excited for spring break next week.
367.24	7.53	That's just another week, and I will be visiting my family for spring break, so I'm really, really excited about that.
375.35	4.06	It's been a while since I've seen my family and my dog.
380.68	5.0	I saw them last Thanksgiving in November, so it's been a couple of months.
386.21	3.59	And I think I really miss them a lot
389.91	3.47	and really looking forward to visiting them.
394.47	6.34	It's kind of a long flight, but still really, really worth it to make that long flight.
401.87	4.67	And I will visit them during spring break.
408.05	5.47	I'm really excited for my mom's food and to see my dog.
416.57	7.78	And next week I think I have my math project to finish up.
426.68	5.51	It's a group project, so I still still kind of need to figure out who's working on which part.
432.27	3.44	And we also need to record a presentation of us.
438.32	6.81	We need to submit a presentation of our project, so we still have to make the slides.
445.8	10.91	We have to kind of actually work together to kind of divide which part and who's going to work on which part, but I have that to finish.
456.98	10.29	And I also have a public health project coming up, and I kind of want to get started on that before heading off for spring break.
468.92	11.31	And for the public health project, I think it's just you make an individual portfolio kind of based on, we're looking at the opioid pandemic right now.
480.31	20.22	So, we have to look at the many different resources and like a resource base to kind of see which companies really cause or responsible for the opioid pandemic, and any consequences and what they're up to now.
500.71	4.53	So, it's kind of like a case file we have to make of all these different companies.
506.39	8.24	And so, I have the two projects, two assignments to get started on before spring break.
515.69	7.62	And besides that, I think I'm all...I also have to go to my lab.
523.71	3.8	We're also writing a paper, so that's also busy.
528.28	8.77	And I'm also tutoring at the elementary school at Henderson Hopkins, so that was something new this semester I tried.
538.17	4.26	So, we're tutoring fourth to eighth graders for math.
543.01	2.49	So, we help them out with their homework.
546.22	6.85	We also prepare like special engagement activities so that we can become a little bit more closer with them.
554.14	3.31	And so far, I think I really like it.
558.14	10.27	I've been to a couple of tutoring sessions, about like five or six, and we're already making connections with the kids.
569.48	5.19	I really like the kids, and I think the kids are enjoying it a lot as well.
576.89	10.61	I also have a couple of more sessions left to go, and I think that's what I have to do before spring break.
588.27	11.26	And after spring break, it's another season of midterms and exams, so I need a good kind of...
599.73	3.29	I don't really want to do work during spring break, but...
