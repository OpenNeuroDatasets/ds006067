1.96	10.73	Okay, um, so right now I'm laying on an MRI machine with a mirror in front of me, pointing at a screen that I think is behind me.
14.78	8.42	I think that's pretty cool because if I had a mirror facing the other way when I was at home, I could watch TV while laying on the couch.
29.37	7.88	The screen in front of me has, right now it's grey, but it used to have the Apple wallpaper with the desert.
38.26	8.57	I actually have the same wallpaper on my computer and, I don't know, I've had it for a long time.
47.14	6.14	I guess it's just been really consistent and it changes during the day and during the night, which is pretty cool, I think.
55.33	8.6	Recently I was told to read this book and my friend actually had the book so I was reading it before I came here.
64.99	1.41	It's called Clara and the Sun.
68.47	9.69	It's like, It's like, It's about these artificial robot intelligences that are basically made to be friends with children.
78.78	5.36	And it's like, I've only gone through half of the book but it's pretty scary, I think.
84.53	9.57	Just like the whole idea and everything, how socializing, and that can be so affected by lack of a friend.
94.62	11.38	And that's like the whole point of having those robots and how the artificial robots aren't perfect by any means because they're also messed up kids, just like the rest of the kids.
108.05	9.27	I've only gone through half of the book and they were talking about some other things that I haven't gotten into yet, so I'm not exactly sure what it means.
118.19	9.32	They were talking about kids that were lifted and kids that weren't lifted and how that's unfortunate for this one kid that wasn't lifted.
128.82	5.4	I thought that was pretty interesting because I assume that's some enhancement of some sort.
137.57	8.36	Speaking of all of that stuff, it's like artificial intelligence and stuff, it reminds me of like chat GPT.
148.02	7.96	Chat GPT, in particular how some people I know are using it to write cover letters, which is crazy.
157.07	10.07	They would just write all of their things, put it into chat GPT and then it would just pop out a great cover letter and then they would just use the format of that to write their own cover letter.
169.72	2.65	I'm wondering when that stuff will be used.
174.68	4.1	Like AI will be advanced enough to detect when someone actually does that.
188.21	6.67	I feel like by talking I'm moving my head around a lot and that's kind of making me concerned.
198.32	2.02	This thinking time is supposed to be 10 minutes long.
200.38	1.94	It feels very, very long.
204.96	9.28	Over the last few weeks I was, I was at home, at break, during break I was at home.
216.81	5.16	I'm from LA but my parents moved up to San Francisco and the Bay Area.
223.45	3.78	It was really nice but I didn't really know anyone there.
228.12	1.59	It was really recent that they moved.
230.79	5.44	I was just up there by myself doing nothing every day except just walking around the neighborhood.
237.4	8.22	I did a lot of walking and playing Pokemon Go while I walked because I got super into that recently, which is also kind of dumb.
248.86	7.21	Aside from that, I didn't really do much except just cook and eat while my parents were at work.
256.86	1.76	I did a whole bunch of chores.
259.97	1.15	I was like their maid for a bit.
261.18	1.19	They were really happy about that.
265.64	2.75	For a week actually I did drive down to LA.
268.94	5.84	And then there was like pretty crazy flooding back in San Francisco and the LA area.
277.04	4.02	It was this whole weather thing that I saw on TikTok but I don't really remember it.
281.54	5.32	I just know that in the week that I was in LA, San Francisco was completely flooded.
288.03	2.4	There were videos of the streets having tons of water.
291.46	2.6	But then when I was in LA, LA was perfectly fine.
294.15	0.96	It was just light rain.
296.7	2.94	the rain on the drive was pretty bad.
299.8	0.7	It was pretty scary.
302.0	1.94	Other than that, LA was pretty dry.
304.49	4.65	And then I come back up to San Francisco and then LA is all flooded.
310.78	1.35	That was really lucky, I guess.
312.15	3.79	I avoided all the flooding during my break.
321.8	2.62	In LA, it was pretty fun.
324.77	2.71	I didn't really do much except just hang out with friends.
329.65	2.16	I guess that's a lot compared to the rest of my break.
334.9	0.8	I have this one friend.
336.76	2.3	His mom is an interior designer.
339.77	2.45	His house is always so beautiful.
343.32	1.19	It's like a whole art museum.
346.05	5.53	The way that the furniture just comes together, I would never think of anything like that.
352.05	6.89	If I were asked to decorate a room, I would just go to Ikea and get grays and blues and beige.
359.52	1.37	That would be just my whole room.
362.85	3.76	But man, oh my god, this is crazy how good she is.
367.22	5.69	Her design of the living room and everything.
372.96	3.05	She even had people put speakers into the walls.
376.39	2.16	It was something else.
381.45	3.64	And that friend of mine, he is an art student.
385.57	3.45	He did art all of his life and right now he's at an art school.
390.35	1.07	I think art is super cool.
392.83	4.18	I personally have never been able to draw or do anything of that sort.
397.48	2.88	I think that's otherworldly talent.
402.66	1.26	At least in the scope of my mind.
407.5	5.05	He goes to a school right now in this place called Art Center in Pasadena, California.
414.39	2.53	It's this huge building that's...
419.15	10.22	I guess the best way to describe it would be just like a tall rectangle that is really chamfered on the edges.
430.44	6.17	The edges of every side of the rectangle is super chamfered to the point where it's like...
439.22	2.28	If you squint hard enough, you can think it's like an oval.
444.57	2.6	It's this big, really tall, black building.
448.33	1.39	It's all glass, I think.
450.34	4.54	And then it has this huge red dot on one corner of it.
455.07	2.19	Like an Apple product or something.
458.41	0.67	I think that's super cool.
459.12	3.62	I've never been inside of it, but I've looked at it a bunch of times.
462.77	4.66	And on the ground floor of the building, it just displays sculptures and stuff.
469.14	3.52	With clear glass around it, obviously, so passersby can see it.
474.31	0.99	I think that's pretty awesome.
476.57	2.48	I would love to have a tour inside.
492.23	7.39	Back in San Francisco, I remember I was trying super hard to be healthy and do cardio every day.
500.81	7.53	My walks, they began as really fast runs.
509.04	3.56	Then quickly, I realized it's not really good for you.
513.49	1.03	I realized that especially when...
518.26	10.83	During the past semester, during the end of the past semester, I guess I overused my tendon that connects to my thumb.
531.69	3.4	I pulled it really hard one night when I was sleeping.
535.86	1.62	I woke up in the middle of the night remembering.
538.22	0.85	I just remember that.
539.25	1.36	Then I was pulling it really hard.
542.94	5.05	It basically hurt really bad, just to bend my entire left thumb.
549.49	6.06	I web-updated it, obviously, and then just basically figured out what it was, to the best of my knowledge.
556.0	1.71	And YouTube and Google.
560.76	2.94	It's called De Quervain's tenosynovitis.
563.77	3.26	And the point of it is the tendon sheath.
567.19	2.04	The tendon basically gets inflamed.
569.6	2.61	They rub against each other so much that they get inflamed.
574.59	2.85	I go back home, and I get a doctor's appointment for that.
579.09	4.43	Basically, the doctor, she seemed really tired.
583.9	5.43	She was really tired of, just like, I don't know, minor cases that people are coming in for.
590.12	4.02	She just bends my wrist a bunch of times, and then it hurts so bad.
595.24	3.82	She literally gave me a printed PDF of what I saw online.
599.8	1.4	I was like, wow, that sucks.
