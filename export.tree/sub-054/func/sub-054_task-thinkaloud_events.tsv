18.19	5.96	I don't know if I'm supposed to start now but it don't turn into a fixation cross, so I'll just go.
29.57	25.06	Let me think about what I need to do today after this because there's something that I really should not forget, which is that I really need to pick up the package, umm, that my mom sent me from Korea, and it's sitting in the post office because they never... For some reason, they can never deliver it to my house and they always take it back to the post office.
55.05	3.53	This is like the third time that had... That's happened so I need to go there.
59.8	4.49	Umm, which reminds me, oh, I need to get like a Christmas present for Andy.
64.34	1.32	I don't know what to get him.
65.97	1.06	Maybe I'll get him a scarf.
68.14	4.51	I have a scarf as well, so, you know, it'll be like a nice little couple item.
74.53	9.41	Umm, and then I'll... Actually, thinking about Andy, I, I have to meet out with him after the post office and hopefully he'll gimme a ride back home.
88.01	4.78	And then I have dinner plans with my friends and I'm thinking about getting ice cream after that
92.84	12.05	because I've been craving, craving ice cream for so long, but I haven't had the chance to get some, you know, I was a really big fan of, uh, strawberry cheesecake,
105.39	2.38	but I think I might get chocolate this time.
109.89	6.54	Uh, but then wait, ugh, I, I think I've been getting... I'm gaining weight so I... Maybe I shouldn't
117.52	10.03	which reminds me... I don't think you should remind me but I do need to get some snacks for this weekend since my friends are coming over.
128.32	4.02	Umm, or I need to go to Giant and get some groceries.
132.73	0.82	What do I need?
133.77	7.3	Maybe I need... I think I need more milk and maybe some oranges.
141.1	1.62	I've been running out of fruit.
146.82	4.92	I think I have a list of what I need to get on my phone but I need to check.
154.13	17.43	On a different note, I'm so glad that the semester's over because, yeah, it's the last... It's, it's the last semester that I've had classes and it's... It feels weird that I haven't... That I'm not going to have any classes anymore so I'm a...
171.7	5.45	I'm a little worried for next semester's TA class because I think it's like a lot of work.
177.66	7.57	I thought it was gonna be a breeze but, oh, I'm a little worried, but at least we have like four TAs so it might be easier.
190.0	2.19	I wonder when I'm gonna have my advance exam.
194.79	8.47	I mean, I think it might be best if I have it like sometime in August maybe, and then I could go to Korea afterwards but I need to... I really need to talk to this about... Uh, talk to my advisor about this.
214.05	7.41	I am so... I don't know, I, I don't even know how to prepare for it so I'm not sure how I'm gonna... How much time I need to spend on it.
223.03	6.38	And then after my advanced exam, hopefully, I'll be able to go to Korea because I haven't been in such a long time.
230.4	7.05	I wish I could bring my parents over here but, you know, they're busy and it's always easier for me to go.
238.64	2.73	I kind of miss my friends, I think.
242.4	13.01	But that reminds me, I think, uh, one of them told me they might come this next year but I hope they don't come like too close to my exam.
256.84	7.52	Umm, but if they do come, oh my gosh, it would be so nice to go on like day trips with them, trips...
264.41	6.35	That reminds me, oh, I need to get a wedding gift for my best friend.
271.38	6.0	She was... She got married with... Also actually, another one of my best friends, uh, quite recently.
277.91	5.98	They are in New Zealand right now but they're gonna get to the US in a couple months.
290.51	1.21	I wonder what I should get them.
293.47	3.71	Maybe like something like a... Maybe about a TV or a fridge.
299.74	3.06	What do people usually get for close friends?
305.9	9.75	I think they are going to... Yeah, I think they're going to stay in California so I might go and visit them.
316.89	0.83	That would be nice.
318.43	0.94	California.
319.43	1.65	Yeah, that reminds me of SFN.
321.89	2.03	SFN was amazing.
324.08	2.13	It was different from what I expected.
327.13	13.21	It was definitely different from what I... What I experienced when I was an undergrad because as... Going to SFN as an undergrad was a breeze compared to what I experienced.
341.36	17.55	Umm, you know, like... It was like a... As an undergrad who was there, I think the only thing that I was focused on was the poster but this time, it was so different.
358.95	9.28	I mean, there were people that I had to meet and like, even the poster presentation wasn't just about me presenting.
368.97	7.45	It was also about like discussion and answering questions and meeting new people that could give me like really good advice.
377.92	1.22	So yeah, that was really nice.
379.19	4.83	And it was really also nice to get people from my, uh, old lab.
384.72	1.25	It was nice to see them again.
387.5	5.72	It was my first time in, in, umm, San Diego.
393.32	2.09	I'd only been to San Francisco before
396.14	5.24	and talking like this, I'm a little worried right now that I am moving my head a little too much.
401.72	3.2	Well, I'm trying not to, but I don't know.
404.94	7.11	I think from while I'm speaking, I'm like... I'm moving my head unintentionally.
412.21	1.25	I'm sorry if that's happening.
414.53	6.08	Umm, yeah, future plans, it's Christmas soon.
420.67	0.83	I am so happy.
421.54	1.22	It's Christmas.
423.01	1.87	It's like my favorite holiday of the year.
426.45	8.19	Oh, I'm gonna go see the Nutcracker Ballet next week and I am so excited about that
434.74	8.61	because it's been my family tradition to watch the Nutcracker Ballet every year, umm, since I was like three or four-years-old.
444.37	7.25	Umm, I guess... I mean, the tradition kind of stopped when I... Umm, when I grow up, after I grow up.
451.95	4.16	Like I, I've been with my friends or like my boyfriend after that.
457.08	4.73	But yeah, it's the first time I'll be seeing it in the US so I'm pretty excited.
461.84	11.94	And I heard it has kind of... Some kind of like a DC, umm, theme to it so it's different from the... From the original version so we'll see how that goes.
475.88	4.64	I wonder how much time is left, because I'm running out of things to say.
488.64	10.55	I need to... I really need to write Christmas cards for my friends because I'm very thankful for some of them.
499.25	4.59	Like they've helped me out, umm, numerous times this year.
505.13	4.11	And yeah, I need to get some cards for that.
509.3	6.61	I should go to Target at one point before Christmas and I really need to think about what I'm gonna write.
526.0	11.23	Tomorrow, I'm going to the Christmas market in New Harbor, you know, and I'm a little worried about that because I know that it's gonna be super cold tomorrow.
537.88	4.31	So hopefully it doesn't like snow too much or it's not like too cold.
543.25	5.97	Umm, yeah, they gave us like nice little mugs last year.
549.26	4.31	I wonder if they have them again or if they're like in different designs.
555.96	12.06	What time should I meet... Meet up with my friends, around... Maybe around like... Maybe I'll meet them around 7:00 or 6:00, 6:00 or 7:00 at New Harbor.
569.19	6.43	That means I can leave the lab at like 5:00 or wait, do I have lab meeting tomorrow?
577.23	13.21	I know that today's... Wait, I know that Jacob's leaving today to visit his family so maybe we don't have lab meeting tomorrow.
590.56	5.38	That'll be nice because then I can just stay home and do stuff and then just go straight to New Harbor.
597.97	2.28	If we do have lab meeting, that'll be like 2:00 PM.
