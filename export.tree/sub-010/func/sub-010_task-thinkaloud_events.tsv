4.09	10.26	Uh right now I think the biggest thing I’m thinking about is just a little bit of anxiety but it’s always a question of chasing down why I’m anxious.
17.04	5.76	Like a little bit maybe of just generalized medical anxiety?
22.99	1.95	Um plus new things.
26.41	2.37	Also having stuff to do later uh.
29.5	4.33	And to go finish dealing with my kits um which is fun.
34.88	15.35	Having done a lot of my kits cause everything’s expired um which really shouldn’t be my problem um cause I’m trying to avoid being stressed about that but doesn’t always work.
51.69	3.53	But after that but not much to do.
55.92	3.32	Calculate some venmo requests which is fine.
60.25	21.47	It’s really annoying having to deal with like utilities and stuff um and the math of that especially because they they just gave us back our bge security deposit of 3204 um so we have to well I have to do the math there on what that means um which is fun.
84.77	4.84	Generally this week isn’t that bad it just keeps getting busier somehow.
90.17	1.85	Things always getting added uh.
92.96	7.43	Have to drive home to Spotsylvania tomorrow um which if im lucky will be under 3 hrs.
100.48	3.45	Um I should check the traffic again after this.
104.49	3.73	Uh cause last time I checked it was hovering at like two and a half which is really bearable.
108.24	0.98	I can do two and a half.
111.69	1.1	I can do three really.
114.22	2.51	More than three I’ll start getting unhappy but.
117.72	1.1	I get to see my aunt.
118.84	3.61	Get to see her dog um which is good.
123.74	1.64	We’re doing it in the day.
125.38	2.18	Just doing dinner and coming back is a lot.
130.9	1.79	But I haven’t I haven’t seen my aunt in a while.
133.67	3.76	Emily saw her cause she was uh in Atlanta for whatever reason.
137.94	8.32	Um but she she’s like doing this it’s really weird I think to do with like a midlife crisis is to go do a divinity program at Notre Dame um.
146.95	2.77	That’s what she’s doing and you know.
151.21	2.05	It It fits her personality really.
154.05	7.0	Just odd cause nobody in my family is really that religious and then she’s one who became super catholic and she wasn’t even raised catholic.
170.92	1.82	Shelby’s old too now um.
176.46	3.26	Aunt mary got Shelby right around when we got Connor.
180.01	5.25	There’s this really cute photo of the two of them uh cuddling together on the couch.
185.35	4.2	Um where it’s like a whole yin yang thing cause she’s really light and he was black.
192.47	1.77	Just random photos floating around.
200.12	4.44	Oh my mom sent one of finn um you know being adorable cause he’s a puppy.
204.56	0.62	He’s pretty cute.
208.28	5.85	But she’s a very awkward dog he puts his ears back in all the photos which makes him look weird um.
215.21	1.27	Yeah it will be good to see *.
216.48	8.83	He he’s just so afraid of Jackson which is really weird because um he wasn’t afraid of Zack uh.
225.38	6.43	And I mean Zack’s taller definitely maybe lankier.
231.91	2.54	But he he wasn’t afraid of Zack as much.
234.65	4.73	And then every time like Jackson moves he doesn’t even have to leave the room and Fitz starts yelling at him.
240.48	0.56	He’s a weird dog.
242.0	1.68	Um very skiddish.
243.68	8.36	He’s gotten better for sure definitely um but being raised in a pandemic probably isn’t good for puppies being scared of things.
255.28	1.61	Duncan almost tolerates him now though.
257.17	0.38	That’s good.
270.8	1.86	To do list is shortening definitely.
273.22	2.31	But at night it’s going to get longer again.
281.31	2.81	The meeting on Thursday which I’m really not looking forward to.
284.12	1.12	It maybe it’ll maybe it’ll be good.
285.32	0.4	I don't know.
286.08	3.95	Um but having to do it period is like its not super exciting.
291.79	3.16	But we’re also doing poker night so that’s a good thing.
295.76	2.48	So theoretically it balances out um.
299.37	2.56	And victor’s back tomorrow um.
303.0	2.34	Not that we’ll be here but he’s back um.
305.67	1.15	Other people back this weekend.
306.92	4.03	Summer’s so weird cause everyone’s just gone all the time um in and out.
312.11	5.71	Then half the time people like leave and they’re like I don't even know when I’m coming back um just like eventually when they do um.
319.41	1.91	Jillian may or may not be here the 20th.
321.6	4.32	Grace just said mid-August whatever that means um I don't know.
328.61	0.56	Doesn’t matter too much.
329.27	5.57	Now now that Grace’s subletter is gone the things that matter in our house not just.
336.51	0.52	They’re fewer.
339.42	1.63	Doesn’t matter as much what happens to me.
344.15	5.9	I think as subletters go they were they were really nice and all it was just a little weird all around uh.
350.39	6.05	And there’s that one party that they uh didn’t love which fair I guess.
368.83	13.82	I wonder what Grace is going to do with her room when she gets back cause like just the wardrobe makes no sense in there and I don't know why she wants it but like it is good for storage certainly but uh.
384.59	2.6	Having a wardrobe makes no sense takes up way too much space.
387.28	7.94	It’s like that um there’s the feng shui guy on tik tok who like basically is like if this is what your room layout is this is how best to arrange it.
395.81	5.04	But he’s just focused on like aesthetics not on the actual space of the room.
400.96	2.14	Well sort of he is but um.
405.64	1.19	What you’re not supposed to have your.
406.86	4.78	Your bed against a window is bad um.
411.69	8.35	But you don’t also don't want to be like directly facing the door and you want to be up against a wall I think maybe I don't I don't remember.
420.84	0.7	Vaguely interesting.
421.64	4.69	It’s really good cause he makes little cutouts of uh all the furniture and puts them in um.
427.51	4.01	So theyre very satisfying videos at least uh if nothing else.
442.24	3.88	There’s something I was thinking about doing with my room but I don't remember what it was uh.
447.9	1.53	Oh I was like what if I got a TV?
449.48	1.59	No I have zero use for a TV.
451.13	1.22	I don't need one um.
454.0	4.34	Like I’d much rather sit down and watch something on my iPad then go.
459.1	2.54	Like they use a TV but I’m just like what if I did?
461.76	2.68	And I probably have space for one it’s just silly and unnecessary.
464.98	5.4	It’s cause someone was selling it on facebook marketplace that’s why I was like oh what if um.
472.36	3.48	But at this point like I don't really need to acquire more stuff.
476.05	9.08	Like my God when we were moving it was just so much like random shit that like also didn’t get moved for like a month so clearly it’s not that important.
487.84	4.38	It’s just very silly like that you know we clearly don't need it.
492.36	3.55	Why we’re moving clutter from one house to another for no reason.
498.99	0.58	Just weird.
502.16	3.28	Some of it’s fun but most of it’s just uh not worth it.
512.33	1.77	I’m not cold so that’s good um.
514.66	1.12	I was worried I’d be cold.
522.68	3.87	Though it would be really nice if the weather were to cool off again.
526.9	4.5	There was like a week a couple days where it was really nice and cool.
531.4	4.67	It was great for giving tours um cause those tours oh my God.
536.46	4.08	It’s like I was literally outside for like an hour a day and I was getting sunburnt consistently.
541.28	0.53	Um was that avoidable?
541.81	4.56	Yes but it’s just how it goes um.
549.27	1.83	I’m done with those now uh.
553.1	0.03	Which is good.
553.17	3.14	People really ask dumb questions on tours.
557.76	3.88	But I also think I forgot how to answer questions so I’m just getting rambly here um.
562.49	4.68	Which this doesn’t help with the the feeling of rambling cause I’m just sitting here rambling um.
569.09	4.94	But yeah someone asks a question and it takes you like a full four minutes to answer it.
574.39	1.58	I literally had a dad tell me on one of them.
575.98	2.95	He was like you answered the question I was like sorry I know I’m rambling.
579.08	6.39	Um he he wasn’t rude about it or anything it was just like silly.
594.19	1.52	I might have to oh that’s a pain.
596.21	6.21	I might have to give the jeep back to my parents um so that my mother can um.
