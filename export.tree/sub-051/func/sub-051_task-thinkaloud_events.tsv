2.23	7.83	Uh, I'm noticing that I'm a lot more calm this time as compared to last time.
10.85	3.68	Um, I was really nervous the last time.
15.33	12.75	Uh, the whole feeling of going inside the scanner being similar to lying at the upper part of a train, it's still the same, which is funny.
29.05	6.48	Um, I'm thinking about what I had for breakfast this morning.
36.29	4.12	It was rajma and roti with chai.
41.5	9.63	Um, I also talked to my mom on video call while having breakfast, which was nice.
52.5	10.03	Uh, this reminds me that my cat, Murphy, usually takes up most of the screen time during video calls.
65.02	4.71	I just love showing everyone her shenanigans. [chuckle]
72.47	8.6	I also have to pack later tonight to go to Street College tomorrow morning.
82.78	4.64	From there, I'll be working remotely for the next one week or so.
89.87	3.35	That reminds me of a lot of work in which needs to be done.
94.45	5.3	The next week, oh, I have to prepare behavioral tests.
100.66	5.56	I have to prepare a website for piloting stimuli.
109.5	3.16	This reminds me of next semester what I'll be doing.
113.44	8.11	I, I'm excited about TA for cognitive psychology course.
123.33	15.27	Uh, the topics are quite interesting and I have taken the course before, uh, but I have no idea of what TA-ing the course would look like so,
138.67	1.48	yeah, looking forward to that.
143.19	3.6	Um, the new year is coming.
147.38	5.46	It doesn't feel like, uh, one year has passed.
152.87	2.45	It, it... Time goes away so quickly.
156.75	15.27	Um, today, after the scan, oh, yeah, I have to go to get groceries also to cook tonight's dinner.
173.79	15.18	Um, I'm thinking of making some potato dish, some spicy potato dish and also an eggplant dish.
191.42	5.16	Um, my lips feel a bit dry at the moment.
198.29	10.98	Uh, um, the bus ride here was good.
210.58	7.98	Uh, I waited in the bus for a few minutes before it started
220.04	6.2	and the weather was not as cold outside today, which was good.
226.88	1.35	There are some sunlight.
229.52	9.5	Uh, but I am looking forward to snow and ice skating and skiing.
241.45	7.2	Um, yesterday I submitted the last of my exams of the semester
250.08	4.37	and I'm feeling quite good about the semester being over.
256.84	2.38	It's a bit liberating. [chuckle]
262.66	6.14	I'm excited for the next part of the experiment, listening to stories.
270.16	14.07	This reminds me I will also be working on some story-related experiment with deaf people maybe sometime in the future.
285.91	20.2	Uh, yeah, uh, this reminds me I couldn't go to the deaf meet up which took place two weeks ago because of all the work and not being well.
307.33	4.94	Uh, I'll be going to their next meeting in January.
319.3	6.33	I found an interesting book yesterday that I might read during the winter break.
326.57	16.14	It's about linguistic anthropology and sign languages that have developed in villages all around the world where deaf communities live in isolation.
344.62	4.61	And it would be interesting to see how these languages have emerged.
357.18	2.36	Uh, I need to call my friends in India.
360.49	5.89	I have been really busy this semester and couldn't talk to them often.
367.95	1.74	I guess I'll do that this week.
380.67	2.72	I am learning sign language
383.42	3.95	and I'll also practice that this week.
388.49	4.15	Uh, I haven't really been practicing that often.
394.4	14.59	I also want to learn Kannada, which is a South Indian language, um, to be able to talk to my partner's family in their native language.
410.11	2.02	I'll maybe start doing that soon.
413.97	13.61	Um, I'm thinking about how I'm not able to think anything right now.
433.85	16.22	I am thinking about how my participants will feel while lying inside the scanner and how I should instruct them so that they feel comfortable and not nervous.
451.77	19.06	Um, yeah I am worried that, um, I might not perform well and yeah, those are some of the apprehensions that I have as of now.
476.06	11.74	I, I'm also again thinking about the grocery shopping that I need to go today evening and what I need to buy.
488.92	12.43	I think uh, I'll buy some vegetables, uh, ginger and maybe some baking supplies also.
502.8	3.93	Uh, now that the semester is over I might make something.
508.39	4.94	Perhaps not here, but at Street College since I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
514.99	13.57	Uh, I also need to pack my cat's food and her favorite bed.
530.54	8.39	Uh, I haven't refilled my bird feeder in the past couple of days.
540.54	8.7	Um, the birds just keep... Eat everything within two or three days.
550.47	6.66	And more than the birds, there is a squirrel who steals most of their food.
558.89	8.18	Um, I think that squirrel is my cat's friend, I guess.
578.68	2.64	Yeah, my lips are really dry, I think I might, uh.
584.13	12.93	Uh, I'm thinking about the people who are sitting outside, uh, listening to me speak.
