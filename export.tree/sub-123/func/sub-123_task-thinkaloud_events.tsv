2.53	5.32	I'm thinking about the noise.
8.29	2.01	Definitely louder than I thought it'd be.
13.47	8.73	But also, I was thinking about the stars from the picture and how much I enjoy the stars.
23.47	7.01	And then I was thinking about a camping trip that my partner is taking soon…
32.66	2.08	…to somewhere in California, I think.
37.11	2.5	I wish I could go because it would be really fun…
39.9	1.11	…but I have school.
42.58	1.87	And I have a really busy semester.
46.14	5.78	I have my internship, which I just came from.
54.04	5.04	And then I'm thinking of mindfulness exercises that we do.
60.77	9.9	So, it's a lot of breathing exercises to calm the brain and to just become more present.
71.87	3.82	I'm trying to be present during this.
86.14	3.04	I have a busy week coming up,
90.54	2.42	including today.
94.23	3.78	I have a meeting after this that I'm leading.
99.34	2.62	I didn't have time to create the agenda.
106.09	2.2	We have a lot to do to get ready for it.
113.55	2.94	So, I'm just thinking about everything I have to do.
122.42	6.3	And then I have to write my case notes for all the clients I saw today
130.05	1.9	because I didn't get a chance to.
136.35	4.89	I'll probably do that tomorrow and try to get it all done…
142.23	11.04	…so that this weekend, I can focus on the conference and everything I need to do for that.
162.59	8.68	The white plus sign is making me think of winter and snow.
175.09	2.71	Disappointed that we didn't get any snow this year.
179.55	6.32	It is actually the first year or the first winter of my life that I've never had snow…
190.14	3.74	…which is kind of sad because I enjoy snow.
195.35	3.14	I don't enjoy the cold, but I do like the snow.
201.81	2.91	But then, that is making me think of Switzerland.
206.38	9.12	I am going on a trip in September to Germany and Switzerland.
217.11	1.96	And I'm really looking forward to that.
223.11	3.68	I've been to Switzerland before and it was really nice.
228.74	3.83	I'm thinking of the mountains and the Alps…
238.1	0.95	…and hiking.
244.31	2.19	And I've never been to Germany…
248.15	2.55	…so I'm excited to see how that goes.
254.26	6.22	I'm going with my partner and his sister and brother-in-law.
261.53	1.94	And they're really fun to be around.
263.6	5.18	So I'm thinking about that because it makes me happy.
269.96	6.14	Especially when I'm stressed out about this semester and having to do so much.
276.65	0.8	That's helpful.
284.38	1.23	I'm kinda hungry,
285.97	4.37	so I'm thinking about dinner.
293.2	2.06	I just got a bunch of groceries.
297.56	5.31	So, I'm thinking about what I want to make.
305.24	2.18	There's some pasta.
309.32	2.04	So, I can add some things to that.
314.14	1.58	Or I can make some chicken
315.88	4.64	because then, I'll have leftovers tomorrow…
320.85	4.75	…which would be good because I'm not good at packing lunch.
327.94	3.04	And then I could have the leftovers with me.
342.23	19.39	I'm thinking about how today was kind of frustrating…because I had a bunch of clients come to my office...and I wasn't able to see all of the clients that I wanted to see.
364.6	10.87	And a lot of clients don't really have consequences when they act out…
377.11	4.93	…which is frustrating and stressful.
390.41	3.31	Tomorrow, I wanted to see one of my clients.
395.07	3.63	But he's on a field trip, so I won't see him.
400.5	2.52	For this week or next week.
405.42	2.07	Next week is spring break.
411.29	3.29	So, I'm going to have a little bit of a break.
417.07	2.68	So I'm very excited about that.
425.28	2.83	I still have a lot of work to do for the conference.
431.65	9.17	But at least, I'll be able to use some of my extra time to get that done.
444.12	3.02	I should probably do something fun…
449.75	5.52	…but I don't know if I'll have the time.
461.47	6.24	I also have a paper due next week that I need to work on.
470.42	2.79	It shouldn't be that hard or take that long…
474.66	5.73	…but I need to get started on that.
482.19	2.83	It's stressing me out that it's not done yet.
487.18	3.02	But also, I'm procrastinating.
498.35	2.08	I'm thinking of video games now…
503.79	4.23	…'cause the little plus sign and the beeping.
510.18	4.19	Kinda reminds me of old video games.
517.83	4.94	Like the one, like Space Invaders.
524.38	1.8	Thinking of that.
531.03	10.0	I'm thinking of my partner because he loves the old Pac-Man video games.
541.05	8.0	And then I'm thinking of a bar by my house that has a bunch of video games.
555.74	13.17	And that makes me think of when my brother came to visit with his wife and we went to that game or that bar.
571.87	3.27	And it's right by...or it was over the summer.
577.49	5.24	It was summer or spring, and it was September.
586.81	2.28	And they had the Friday night bikes.
