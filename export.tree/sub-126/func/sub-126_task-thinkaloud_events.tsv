1.66	2.65	I hate that I woke up so late today,
6.57	6.67	"because literally every single day, I wake up and I'm like, ""Okay, I wake up at 8 am and I feed Mao."""
14.56	1.49	He looks so cute when he's eating.
16.13	1.11	"I'm like, ""Okay, perfect."
17.32	1.27	"Now I'm going to start my day."""
19.5	2.43	And then I literally go back to sleep.
22.23	2.44	And then I wake up at 10:00 and then I'm late for work.
25.52	6.35	"And then I'm like, ""The next morning, I'm going to wake up early and I'm going to get to work on time."""
32.11	1.85	And then I never do, and then I stay late.
34.1	1.71	And it's just this vicious cycle.
36.8	6.84	And I really don't know how Julia does it, where she wakes up and she gets to work at 8:00 in the morning.
46.2	6.45	But yes, I think I'm just going to ask her for tips because this is getting too much.
55.8	4.66	I wonder what I might eat for dinner later today, probably.
61.64	1.69	Just did groceries yesterday.
63.36	4.29	I got some chocolate chip cookies,
67.82	0.74	but that's not dinner.
72.04	1.88	I made pasta today for lunch,
73.97	1.81	but I'm not going to eat pasta again for dinner.
76.42	1.4	That would be bad, that'd be gross.
78.92	0.95	I'd feel bad later.
80.96	5.11	Oh, but it's Lent, so I have to not eat meat.
86.69	0.82	I suck at Lent.
90.48	3.74	I think I really, really want a shrimp burrito.
94.44	1.62	That's what I want right now,
98.21	1.21	but I'll have it for dinner, I guess.
100.65	1.48	Oh, but Hannah is coming over.
103.31	1.69	I don't know if she'll want burritos.
107.22	1.02	This is difficult.
111.28	3.95	I think Hannah said she wanted to buy pizza again, but I don't know why she wants to buy pizza again…
115.25	2.65	…when she's literally had pizza all this week.
118.24	3.12	So, I don't know what we're going to have for dinner.
123.74	1.46	My aunt's coming tomorrow.
125.49	2.85	What time did she say to meet her again?
131.37	2.92	Hope it's not in the morning because I really wanted to sleep in tomorrow.
136.02	2.38	I think it was 2 am, 2 pm?
138.49	0.53	Not 2 am.
139.13	0.64	That'd be so funny.
140.28	0.87	No, 2 pm.
143.22	3.28	Hope she picks me up from my place because I don't know if she's expecting me to meet her somewhere.
148.04	0.75	That would be funny.
150.34	2.91	I really don't feel like meeting her somewhere.
153.69	1.06	Maybe she'll just pick me up.
156.7	2.86	I'm really excited about the restaurant we're going to tomorrow though.
159.63	1.75	The place sounds delicious.
162.81	5.09	I think I'm going to get an added bar with lots of fillings.
170.59	2.69	And maybe if they have some [indiscernible - 00:03:08], that would be good.
175.63	3.16	I hope my cousin is doing okay in college.
179.87	1.76	He's made friends by now and...
183.01	0.84	is thriving.
184.49	1.15	I really, really hope so.
188.58	1.03	What do I do on Sunday?
193.94	2.1	Well, I mean after church.
196.32	1.54	I hate that church is in English here.
199.17	2.33	I really do feel like God only speaks Spanish.
207.4	2.36	I don't know, maybe I'll go to a friend's house.
212.26	4.53	Make some yummy food for the week, next week, and all that stuff.
216.91	1.6	Do I have a participant visit next week?
222.17	0.87	Oh, I do.
223.29	2.38	I do, I have a participant visit next week.
227.13	1.16	Oh, and it's a long one.
228.35	2.57	I think it's like a long-day kind of thing.
233.9	1.31	Well, that'll be fun.
237.67	2.77	I wonder if I have to buy them lunch if it's that long.
240.81	1.46	I need to check my calendar again.
247.83	1.59	What else do I have going on next week?
250.46	2.01	I really, really need to buy my plane ticket home.
254.69	0.86	I really need to.
255.6	1.0	They're getting really expensive.
256.64	1.25	I don't know what I'm waiting for.
259.26	1.95	Money, I guess, but that's not coming.
262.32	1.71	I really need to buy those plane tickets.
267.28	1.71	Wonder what I'm going to do for my birthday.
270.32	8.26	I want to go to Hersheypark with my friends, but I don't know if they'd be willing to drive all the way over there.
280.63	1.29	God, I'm really dumb.
282.4	1.74	I was really going to say I don't know where it is.
284.19	1.12	It's literally in Hershey.
288.67	1.23	Or maybe Six Flags.
290.0	0.73	That'd be cool.
291.63	1.87	We've already been to Six Flags.
294.37	1.27	Six Flags is so fun.
299.78	3.97	I feel like I just really want to recreate freshman year of college.
303.8	1.97	My friends got me a funnel cake for my birthday.
306.0	0.9	That was so much fun.
307.31	1.46	That was my first funnel cake.
308.94	2.9	I think I want to do that again.
315.67	3.81	Oh, I could get a slushy, the coke ones.
319.67	2.69	Yeah, even though that's so bad for my kidney.
322.43	0.48	It's fine.
324.1	0.77	I should be fine.
327.52	1.64	I really need to buy those plane tickets
329.22	3.96	because I think Carthick and Julie already have made plans for my birthday.
333.21	4.41	"So, that'd be kind of embarrassing to be like, ""Oh my, I'm not going to go."""
342.91	1.59	What else am I doing this month?
345.98	1.98	I think Carthick's brother is coming to town.
348.04	1.09	We're all going to chill.
351.59	3.39	Oh, Krishna, I think we're birthday twins.
356.07	1.61	I think we're birthday twins.
359.2	3.66	And that other guy, that other friend of Carthick's, we're birthday twins too.
363.65	1.56	I wonder what he's doing for his birthday.
366.94	2.81	I wonder what Carthick's going to do since we're all having birthdays at the same time.
369.8	0.71	What is he going to do?
370.55	0.82	Where is he going to go?
376.38	3.43	I wonder what Mao is doing right now at this very second.
381.16	1.38	He's probably taking a nap.
382.67	1.65	He looked so cozy this morning.
385.46	1.16	I wonder what it's like to be a cat.
386.85	14.41	Literally just sleep all day and bother your owner for food, sleep some more, and then get belly rubs and get carried around everywhere, not have a worry in the world.
402.21	0.96	That sounds like the life.
404.77	1.86	What do I have to do today when I get back?
410.7	2.87	I have to send so many email confirmations.
413.63	1.0	I'm so proud of myself.
414.93	1.74	Go me for calling all those people yesterday.
416.77	2.8	But also, that means more work.
421.26	4.21	But also, I guess it's a good thing but also more work.
425.94	1.58	I hope no one calls me while I'm gone.
428.86	1.39	That's like the worst feeling in the world.
433.62	2.14	I wonder what else is on my to-do list today.
436.25	3.58	Just the PowerPoint for Monday.
441.35	3.85	That's like the worst part of my Friday, that little PowerPoint every single Friday.
447.94	1.15	I feel like it'll be shorter.
449.27	6.06	I didn't see anyone this week, so I guess it'll be shorter, easier to do.
457.77	0.66	Got hungry.
458.49	0.77	I should have known better.
459.3	4.54	I should have eaten a bigger breakfast, but I just really wanted to sleep.
465.22	2.41	I really knew that that cheesesteak was not going to be enough.
469.83	1.66	I should have gone with the tangerine.
471.61	1.06	The tangerine was good.
474.25	2.42	Wonder how that tangerine in my pocket is doing.
478.68	2.68	I hope it stays cool, that'd be so sad.
481.42	2.62	Tangerine that's colder is so much better than tangerine that's warm.
484.15	0.97	It's not like pizza.
485.34	1.31	Pizza is good whenever.
486.71	3.82	But tangerines, they're something else, cold.
494.88	1.65	I really don't know what else to say.
496.57	1.53	I don't know what else is on my mind.
498.89	1.14	Wonder how Nicole's doing.
500.07	0.99	I haven't called her in a while.
501.1	0.69	I need to call her.
503.43	3.91	Yeah, I hope she's not sad anymore about that guy.
508.85	5.85	I should give her a call and see if she actually wants to come to Baltimore, like we talked about.
516.61	2.58	But for a whole week, I don't know if I want her here for that long.
520.89	2.14	We'll see, maybe she'll come for a weekend.
523.12	0.99	Maybe that'll be better.
524.67	0.83	Or maybe, you know what?
525.53	1.09	Maybe she should come for a week.
526.66	1.1	I need to be a better person.
531.39	1.32	Wonder what Alana's up to.
534.17	5.84	Just living her best life, saving a hell of money, all that good stuff.
543.56	4.24	I miss being in Puerto Rico, I mean on the beach and stuff.
548.56	2.02	This MRI machine does not sound like the beach.
556.14	4.78	Oh my God, that restaurant we went to, with the pork.
562.61	2.82	It was so greasy and so delicious and amazing.
566.64	1.21	Well, I need to go back.
567.94	1.99	I need to go back tomorrow.
571.23	1.8	I wish, I really wish.
574.37	2.06	I don't know how I'm going to go see Valerie in Spain.
576.47	3.14	That's just going to be so expensive and I'm already so broke.
579.69	1.78	I don't know how that's going to happen.
584.51	1.54	I wonder if the 10 minutes are up already.
586.69	1.0	This is a lot of talking.
587.74	2.45	I feel like I'm not a talker, I'm more like a listener.
594.24	0.89	Maybe it's good practice.
595.2	3.85	Maybe I should be more of a talker, like assert myself.
