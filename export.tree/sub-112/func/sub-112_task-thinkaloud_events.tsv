5.62	11.16	This is a bit of a weird position to lie in because I feel like I can't move my head, so it feels like my jaw is squishing against my chest, and so my chin is just kind of squished.
18.0	2.62	And everything else is just kind of okay, I think.
20.8	3.56	It's definitely good to have my knees up, because otherwise my back would be hurting.
26.16	7.14	I also don't know how loudly I'm meant to talk, so if I'm not talking to anyone, I'm just saying whatever the hell is in my head.
34.68	3.68	But I guess it's probably louder, so I'm just not going to try and speak too loud.
38.98	1.84	I'm just going to keep going, I suppose.
41.54	10.74	There's a lot of beeping, and the beeping is kind of confusing, because I expect it to mean something, but I presume it doesn't mean anything, it's just the MRI scanner doing its thing.
53.84	2.78	Overall, I think this is much better than the last time I was in a scanner.
60.5	1.02	I think that one was maybe four years ago.
62.76	8.72	And that one they were testing what happens to your brain when you have to sight-read pieces of music on a keyboard.
73.94	15.84	So, they took out all the metal components of this little plastic keyboard, and inside a scanner lying down, they had the keyboard on your chest or on your knees, and you had to play music, sight-read stuff, just random stuff that you'd see on the screen.
90.5	1.74	Most of it didn't really make sense musically.
93.24	10.26	It kind of made sense, I'm used to doing that now, and that was really irritating, because it felt like you couldn't play anything accurately, so it was musically speaking very unappalling.
104.06	2.22	It's sort of the name of science, but that's all right I guess.
108.38	12.12	So yeah, there's some floaty things in front of my eye, and usually I assume they're just part of my eye, but because they can't move, it's hard to tell whether or not they're part of my eye or part of the screen, or part of something else in between me and the screen.
124.62	5.08	Ten minutes is a pretty long time, I don't really know how long it's gone, maybe three minutes?
130.68	2.24	I'm not really good at telling how fast time is moving.
135.3	4.84	I'm trying to read, there's a sticker up there, and it has two words on it.
140.26	3.16	I can't read what the words are because my eyesight's really bad, I need to get that checked out.
144.14	4.34	So, I need to look for an optometrist in the area.
148.88	7.42	I just moved here, so I didn't know anything about optometrists in the area, I just need to look that up.
158.2	4.56	But I will need to do that, I suppose in the next five weeks, before I get to sit in this.
165.1	5.56	S,o there's that, and I don't think I've gotten any prescriptions for maybe five years, four years?
171.58	2.18	So that would explain why my eyesight isn't doing so great.
177.32	12.54	They used to tell you that by the time you're in your mid-twenties, the change in your eyesight slows down and doesn't get nearly as fast as when you were a kid.
190.26	5.72	But it hasn't stopped yet, I think I'm basically waiting for it to stop changing so I don't get Lasik.
197.44	5.7	My sister got Lasik, and my older mate got Lasik, and they swear it's the best thing ever after you recover from it.
203.22	8.76	It's really expensive, and I don't really know if I've ever spent that much money on something.
214.2	7.74	So yes, I don't really know how to categorise it as worth it if it's a certain amount of money than it was before.
230.9	4.72	Oh yeah, it's kind of confusing because the screen is behind me, right?
235.74	1.54	I'm looking in a mirror, maybe.
237.38	1.8	I can't look behind me.
241.68	7.9	But I could see the screen before I came in, so that means there must be a mirror pointing to the screen behind me, and that stays constant as I roll towards the screen.
250.54	2.06	Except maybe I got big error, I don't remember.
252.68	4.42	That would make sense if the screen is behind me, like near where my head is.
258.92	2.86	So, I suppose the sticker's not above me, it's behind me.
265.96	7.24	I suppose it must be a good, nice clean mirror for me to forget that it's a mirror and think that it's just space.
278.28	2.78	I kind of run out of things to talk about, I'm just like...
282.9	4.7	I'm not usually someone who can just speak without anything going on in their head.
288.16	3.16	I usually only say things when I feel like they're necessary.
291.78	8.74	So, just sort of speaking and not thinking about whether it's important and not filtering it is just a really weird feeling.
301.34	1.62	It's not what I usually do.
305.26	1.66	I feel like it's really dry in here.
307.88	3.78	I feel like I'm swallowing, and I feel like that's moving my head and it's probably not good for the scan.
312.32	4.52	So, sorry if I'm moving my head because I need to swallow or because I need to speak.
317.44	10.04	I feel like it's truly impossible to actually keep your head steady and not move it a fraction of a millimeter or half a millimeter when you're speaking.
331.38	4.22	I also don't know why I'm speaking with so many breaths in between my sentences.
337.18	2.48	I suppose I've never tried to speak for so long lying down.
341.18	8.26	Maybe I have, and it's just been in conversation with someone, so the flow of your sentences is important and you only breathe when it makes sense.
350.06	5.7	But right now I feel like I'm breathing every fifth word or something and now I'm self-conscious of it, so I'm trying to control it.
357.56	2.64	Maybe it's because I'm taking really shallow breaths because I'm lying down.
360.88	8.28	I wonder how singers, opera singers, are so good at singing in all sorts of contorted positions and moving at the same time.
370.68	0.9	It's kind of amazing.
377.06	2.66	Oh, my God, maybe six minutes have gone.
379.82	1.0	Seven minutes have gone.
381.45	0.55	I have no idea.
389.88	3.54	There's a white cross on the screen in front of me on a grey screen.
395.38	5.24	And it looks like a Mac operating system, so that's fun.
402.86	5.72	It reminds me I need to do some coding today I suppose, or maybe tomorrow.
409.3	5.58	I feel like I've got a bit too much going on right now, so that's kind of exhausting.
415.88	4.9	None of it really has deadlines, none of it feels like the most important thing in the world.
421.52	1.64	I guess I should do them.
425.14	3.13	But I don't really feel like I'm wasting much time these days.
428.64	5.64	Maybe a little bit, but I feel like I'm working most of the time, so I'm not really sure how to be more efficient about that.
435.68	2.9	I'm obviously not pushing myself as much as I did in college.
439.88	5.6	And I don't want to, obviously, I think that's more important than just getting stuff done.
446.36	7.46	But still, sometimes I wonder if I'm not pushing the potential, whatever that means.
454.56	3.78	Just because I'm in general being more relaxed about the way I spend my time.
461.76	5.28	My lips are really dry, I should have gotten some water before I came in here, but I'm not sure where to get water from.
467.48	2.18	And it is cold, I knew it would be cold,
469.68	0.1	I'm always cold.
471.34	2.46	So that's great, but it's not a big deal, I suppose.
473.99	1.0	I can deal with it.
475.06	2.7	I've been colder for longer, so that's that.
481.58	2.24	I wonder what the red pieces of tape are for.
484.06	1.94	Or like the red plastic or whatever that looks like.
487.62	3.4	At the end of this slidey thing.
491.84	2.28	I'm a bit confused, the orientation.
494.58	3.0	I suppose if it's a reflection it's...
498.74	4.56	Well, okay, wait, so the monitor looks like it's the right way around.
503.62	2.22	Like it's not upside down from my perspective.
508.26	2.84	Yes, I suppose it must be in the bottom.
512.2	2.7	Because I doubt they're hanging the monitor upside down.
517.42	4.6	Speaking of which, I need to get an HDMI to USB-C adapter.
522.66	2.78	For my computer, so I can use my monitor.
526.0	1.24	I'm very pleased with.
528.52	3.22	I want to be able to use it, but I can't, so I can't have an HDMI port.
535.72	1.94	Ah, maybe it's been eight minutes.
538.14	1.84	This is so long.
540.82	1.22	It's supposed to be the longest portion.
542.18	2.22	I feel like I can do word association for two minutes.
544.78	2.04	Or whatever that, the word chain here, that's what it's called.
547.18	1.0	And it'll be all right.
549.82	2.94	It's just temporising, ten minutes, so hard.
552.96	3.32	I don't know how people do it, they just talk and talk and talk and talk.
557.56	3.14	Ugh, I feel forced to talk right now, I can't.
560.92	2.3	I'd rather not, I'd rather just lie here in silence.
564.56	1.9	I hope you're getting a laugh out of this.
566.56	1.88	I hope you're enjoying listening to me.
568.7	4.88	I'm sure you must be much more bored than I am of listening to people ramble on.
574.2	2.42	I don't know whether what we say is important.
577.3	3.16	That would be interesting to hear about.
583.56	2.74	Whether or not you actually keep the audio files.
588.06	1.74	I'm sure you encode them in some way.
591.38	2.54	Or filter out our voices.
