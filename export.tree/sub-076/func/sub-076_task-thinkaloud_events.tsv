1.75	4.17	It's very interesting being in this machine right now.
7.19	5.37	I don't know, I guess I never really thought about what an MRI would be like.
13.48	13.34	It's interesting because I feel like we learned about it so much in class and all those lectures, and also that study that I'm doing with Dr. Lam and Dr. Kampson, it's all about the MRIs.
26.98	8.96	I'm just like, imagine all those patients in our cohort lying there and listening to all of these noises.
36.74	8.64	I think it definitely puts things into perspective to go, or I feel like, I don't know, I guess I just do something like this myself.
45.86	6.18	But it's pretty cool, and also kind of nice to just be able to lie here.
54.16	9.4	I think this week has just been so crazy and kind of sad, but I guess this is the most I've been able to relax all day.
63.74	12.92	I also feel really bad because the conference slides and all the mistakes I've made with them, I just hope that Susie isn't too annoyed with me.
78.54	13.82	And I guess going forward I should see how I can maybe just be more vigilant about checking things like that, so she doesn't have to catch my errors for me, even though they weren't even that bad.
93.44	12.6	And I think in my defense, a lot of them were related to clinical things that I just haven't heard as much about, and I just really wasn't aware of, but I guess I probably should have still checked them.
107.02	10.84	Anyways, I think when I get home after this, it should be about like 5.30pm, I have to go to the Thai restaurant to pick up my stuff.
120.28	7.02	And then I think when I get home I want to focus on finishing up the slide deck so that it's ready to go for tomorrow.
128.57	10.99	And then I have like 10 billion lectures to study for tomorrow's exam, and I'm feeling very bad about all of them right now.
139.9	17.32	I think going through the review slides, right before I came here, it was helpful to see what they might ask on the test tomorrow, but it was also like, man, what have I really been learning?
157.28	5.35	I feel like I've been trying to do my Anki cards a lot more vigilantly this far.
163.54	3.81	And I think they have helped.
167.53	5.44	But I also can't really tell because I'll still see something and be like, I swear I've never learned this before.
173.52	3.48	And then I go search in the flashcard deck and it's literally right there.
178.66	8.48	I guess I'm worried that I'm just clicking through all of these flashcards and not actually processing them, which would be its own problem.
187.56	19.92	But anyways, I'll learn everything tonight, I just have to go through all the lectures, and then the divine intervention slide deck, and then make sure I know all the drugs, and the anatomy, which I seem to really like on the quiz.
207.76	7.12	For the quiz, everyone's saying that the test is going to be a lot easier, but it was just so hard that I'm scared now.
215.44	5.1	But on the bright side, I guess we all failed, which is reassuring that it's not just me.
221.22	9.08	But also, what is it with these professors and making the quizzes they put in the middle of the block like super hard, and just demoralizing us all?
230.32	2.46	Because I feel like this has definitely been a recurring theme.
233.64	5.86	And at some point, maybe they should just be like, let's give them something to make them feel better.
239.63	4.04	But I don't know, I guess they think it's helping us learn.
243.85	4.13	And maybe it's scaring us into being better students.
249.82	14.88	But after this exam, I really hope that I don't fail, because if I do, it'll be the first exam that I failed in preclinical, and it's also our last preclinical exam, so it would just be kind of sad to end it on that note.
265.24	12.05	And also, the fact that I would have to retake it during TTW would just be such a bad time, especially when I'm already stressed about this conference that I'm going to.
278.65	10.13	And for the conference, I don't know, it's so weird to feel excited about it at one second, and I'm really scared for it the next.
290.04	6.39	I'm excited to see my friends who live around LA and eat yummy food.
297.07	4.94	Hopefully, it'll be nice and warm in LA, and I'm staying right near the beach, which sounds amazing.
303.14	6.04	But I'm still scared to be the only, I think, red student presenting that day.
309.36	4.7	I feel like everybody's going to be like, who is this girl and who's letting her present here?
315.04	11.82	She's not a fellow, but hopefully what Dr. Lam and Susie are telling me is true, and everybody's just going to be super nice and happy to have me there.
328.2	0.9	But we will see.
329.37	7.44	It's so bad because every time I think about the conference and preparing for it, I just get too nervous and then I don't do anything.
337.99	10.38	But I still have like two weeks, I guess, from tomorrow, which I think should be enough time to get something together.
348.87	10.72	I think that'll also help that next week I have that practice talk with the department here, and hopefully that doesn't go too badly.
359.95	2.81	I will feel more confident after that.
363.72	4.58	I think overall, it should be a really good experience.
369.43	5.43	And I think I'm also just grateful that I was able to get to that point.
375.04	12.21	I think lately I've been feeling really stressed about what I should be doing, and what I am doing and not knowing what it is that I want to do with my life.
388.16	15.16	Everybody else seems to have everything all figured out, and maybe just too many people at Hopkins are trying to do the absolute most.
403.5	6.26	I just really don't want to feel the stress that comes from being around those people.
410.39	11.11	But I think I have also gotten better at just accepting that I'm doing what I can, and feeling happy with what it is that I'm doing.
422.4	7.86	That maybe, I think in terms of feeling that comparison pressure, it seems to have gotten better from last year.
430.66	15.85	I just remember last November it was so bad, and then I think also Simon and Amin were saying the comparison culture feelings that came during that week with time and SCA was also just a lot.
446.69	7.57	Because, I don't know, I guess it's overwhelming to see people just doing like 10 million projects at one time.
456.52	18.3	I don't know, I guess it's hard because a lot of those people doing that are my friends and I love them as people, but I think just the way they act as students sometimes is like, I feel bad because it makes me not want to be around them as much when they're doing that.
474.96	4.59	I know I've had this conversation with Emily and Hanyu too.
480.05	7.61	But sometimes I feel like they also kind of contribute to that culture, even though they definitely don't do it intentionally in any way.
488.48	6.08	Or even in the same kind of really out there doing the most way that other people are doing.
495.47	7.25	But they just also seem to have their lives together a lot and they love doing ENT, so I respect them for that.
502.9	2.66	And I know they have to, and I know that I don't have to.
505.76	2.18	So, I really shouldn't think about it as much as I do.
510.28	8.72	I think, especially after coming from a really big public school where there's so much individuality, I really miss that.
521.08	4.72	I just feel like in college I never really cared as much about what other people are doing.
526.61	7.85	And now that it's such a small environment, I think Dr. Frost described it as a bunch of fish all swimming in the same direction.
535.36	12.12	It's so easy to see what everyone else is doing and feel bad about not doing enough, even though I know that it's totally irrational, and I need to stop thinking like that.
548.3	2.88	But I guess it also helps to know that I'm not alone.
551.99	13.36	And I think when I think about what it is that I want to do, in terms of not even just specialty but also impact and wanting to live life outside of medicine and everything.
566.07	3.99	And I think about the people who I've talked to who also feel the same way.
571.06	13.11	It makes me feel a lot better knowing that as colleagues, I'll be spending more time with those types of people than the ortho gunners who complain about their 13 abstracts.
584.17	3.53	I don't need that kind of toxicity in my life.
588.68	12.58	But yeah, I think going into clerkships in these next few months will hopefully be really helpful and just like, I don't know, I guess figuring out what I want to do and...
