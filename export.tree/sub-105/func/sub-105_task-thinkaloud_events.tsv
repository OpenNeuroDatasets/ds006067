2.26	4.16	Uh, I have a lot of planned to do during the spring break.
7.28	6.39	I have to work on the Genetics homework, the PEBL LA, and what else do I need to do?
14.03	1.78	Oh, I need to send out my tax papers today.
16.79	17.04	And I need to work on my interest forms, I need to look for internships, I also need to go to D.C. with my friend Ryan, and I have to binge like five different movies.
34.74	3.67	Oh my god I have a lot to do and I also have to go to New York.
39.23	4.08	Ugh, what about, what if I don’t finish my assignments then what should I tell him?
44.29	1.15	No, I need to go.
46.02	8.12	I also need to buy tickets for his birthday, and oh my god, I need to pick up my mail today so that I can do the embroidery.
54.83	1.69	But what if I’m really bad at embroidery?
56.57	2.0	Then I wouldn’t have anything to give to him.
59.59	0.95	That’s not good.
60.74	2.49	Ok, it’s ok, I can still go on Amazon today.
64.23	1.89	Uh, what else do I need to do today.
66.2	1.61	Uh, I think that’s it.
67.88	2.04	Oh wait, I need to learn how to make fried chicken.
73.43	4.23	Then, I need to look up ten recipes, and I need to make sure I have paprika.
77.7	1.97	If I don’t have paprika, I need to go to Giant.
81.03	4.69	And, if that doesn’t work out, I’ll just order takeout.
85.73	0.97	I don’t think he minds.
87.8	23.91	And then, I need to call her mom, I need to email the school, I need to ask them about the invites, I need to check the status on the transfer and…I have to call Kathy, finalize our plans.
113.36	1.36	God I have a lot to do today.
114.84	3.24	It’s ok, I can still tutor Ann after I get back home.
122.39	2.78	Where should I go after that?
126.01	1.82	I should just stay in class– stay at home.
128.02	1.88	I should buy more groceries so that I can stay at home.
130.55	2.09	I don’t want to go outside today after this.
133.35	2.34	Yeah, there shouldn’t really be much to do after that.
136.79	2.85	Should I go to Giant or should I just order blue cheese online?
139.93	4.04	Ordering groceries online would be better cause that would save energy to leave my house.
145.03	7.57	And then I need to email for next year’s housing and rent.
152.9	1.35	Oh my god there’s so much to do.
155.1	1.55	Ok, it doesn’t matter. I can do it.
156.78	2.3	I have four whole days to do this.
160.06	4.26	And, where should I go?
165.74	15.85	Ok, I also need to clean out the living room, vacuum, clean out the bathroom, and take out the trash, do my laundry again, probably should start packing.
182.64	1.54	Oh my god, yeah I need to start packing.
185.19	4.08	I’m wondering if I have enough clothes. I do, I probably do.
189.92	2.88	And then get started on that itinerary in New York.
194.48	3.58	I mean we are only going to go there for two days, so there shouldn’t be that much to do.
199.01	3.53	But I need to write down a list of restaurants that I definitely want to go eat at.
202.89	4.53	I should also probably call Alex and see if he’s free so that I can meet up with him if he wanted to.
208.19	1.82	I wonder if Lincha is back in New York.
210.42	1.41	I think he was in Philly?
212.76	1.45	I don’t know where this man is.
214.95	6.71	Ok, and I need to ask Lily if she’s okay with meeting them cause they’re kind of my friends, not really Lily’s friends.
222.98	2.1	I should also ask him if he has friends in New York.
226.87	2.04	Yeah, should probably ask him that.
229.22	1.52	I should stop making plans by myself.
231.68	3.4	But he doesn’t like making plans, he wants me to make plans.
236.9	4.17	Yeah, that's probably best for everyone if I make plans.
241.5	1.67	I should still ask him for his input.
245.11	8.52	I also have to go shopping for Chase’s’ birthday present, probably gonna do it at the same place that I did last year: Soho.
255.4	4.02	And, where else did I want to go in New York?
260.88	1.91	I should go back to Central Park.
263.78	3.89	Last time I was there, I was only there for like a couple hours maybe.
268.34	5.57	We didn’t take that many photos…should take more photos, definitely K-Town.
275.98	4.27	Probably not the Battery…that was underwhelming.
281.43	3.36	Yeah. Should I go to Brooklyn?
285.02	4.11	I have not been to Brooklyn, always stayed in Manhattan.
290.6	2.41	I should call Qing Qi and ask if she wants to meet up.
293.5	2.75	I think she goes to school in Brooklyn, oh, also Cyrus.
297.46	4.48	Probably not talk to Cyrus though, we’re not that close.
303.43	2.28	But definitely Qing Qi, I need to ask her.
306.96	1.67	I wonder who else is going to New York.
308.67	2.46	I think some, some people are going to New York in this break.
311.93	1.16	Maybe we can meet up there.
314.74	4.4	And I’m only gonna go there for two days, so might not even be enough time to meet everyone.
320.86	3.6	Oh my god, so many things to plan out, so little time.
325.58	0.63	It’s fine.
326.85	3.46	If I can’t go, I can always go during the summer.
331.61	4.69	Summer would just be work, lab, New York, Washington, D.C.
336.87	3.24	Oh my god, I’m so proud of Emily for getting into NIH.
341.41	2.81	Ah, I should tell more people, oh, I should tell my mom.
344.33	1.16	She’ll be so proud of her.
346.4	2.22	She’ll be proud of me for having smart friends.
349.62	2.96	Definitely, I should also apply there next year.
354.0	4.26	Actually, no I need industry experience, not more lab work.
359.85	2.68	It’s such a good opportunity though, I should still try.
363.45	1.98	Yeah, I should apply just to see if I get in.
365.98	2.49	If I don’t get in, I don’t get in, who cares.
369.13	0.89	No one cares.
370.66	1.72	No one will even know I applied except me.
373.73	2.23	But I should definitely apply to internships over the summer.
376.43	1.16	I’ve been slacking off.
378.69	5.47	It’s fine, this summer, research, it’s fine, other people are doing it too, it’s not like you’re the only one.
385.93	2.39	You’re definitely not behind.
390.11	4.29	Ugh, oh, speaking of that, I need to talk to McKenler.
395.45	2.98	Need to ask him if I can take the classes next semester that I wanna take.
399.68	1.94	God, that’s gonna be a long process.
402.17	2.83	I hope it’s ok that I want to take them at a 600 level.
405.68	1.84	I need more grad classes.
410.55	3.46	So I wanna take thermodynamics and drug delivery.
414.27	1.86	Is two grad classes too much?
416.71	1.29	I don’t think it’s too much.
418.98	4.77	I mean they’re taught in the exact same way as the undergrad level, I think they're just assessed differently.
424.37	0.85	That should be fine.
426.37	1.43	Plus, I only need to pass.
428.28	1.88	I don’t need to do that well.
431.65	4.62	My focus is gonna be in research anyways, so that should be fine.
441.19	2.82	Why does my classes not relate to any of my research?
444.07	1.67	Like it doesn’t even make sense.
446.32	5.1	Classes are supposed to correlate to what is being– what I’m doing in research so that I will know what to do in real life.
453.0	6.42	But nothing that we learned in class has anything to do with my research or anything to do with what I want to do in life.
460.98	2.19	Maybe that’s because I do research on the med campus.
463.24	2.84	Maybe I should have find research somewhere on campus.
467.7	2.95	No, I don’t think any of my friends are doing that either.
472.35	1.69	Ok, it should be fine.
474.17	1.37	Everything will be fine.
476.41	8.38	I just need to…I just probably need to plan a little bit better about what I’m gonna do for the next two years.
486.25	3.96	Uh, I think I might get a job right after graduation.
491.9	3.92	I really need to pay off my brother’s tuition.
496.75	1.34	Oh my god, my brother.
498.83	4.57	Yeah, I definitely need to know when he needs to come here so I can buy him plane tickets.
504.59	3.81	I also have to help him move in and ask if he needs anything because dorm room.
509.99	3.27	Oh my god, I have no money saved up, I should start saving money.
513.84	0.44	It’s ok.
514.32	3.95	After New York, not gonna spend anything for the next like four months.
519.0	0.93	Think I should be fine.
522.14	3.07	And then I can buy him anything he wants.
526.39	3.71	And I should also probably figure out the bus route to his school.
531.59	0.61	I don’t know how to get there.
532.31	4.77	I know it’s only 10 minutes by the Uber, so it should be like half an hour by bus.
537.54	4.18	I hope the bus runs there, cause I ain’t about to take an Uber every time I go up there.
545.69	5.36	Yeah, oh maybe the metro, Oh but the metro stationed at the med campus not at Homewood.
552.53	5.78	But that’s fine, I can take the bus to this metro station if there’s a connection.
559.45	0.93	I think there’s a bus.
560.61	1.13	There’s probably a bus.
562.99	1.15	There should be a bus right?
566.41	4.14	Yeah, I hope Brian replies to my email soon.
570.65	3.67	I need to figure out this legal, this legal paperwork.
574.97	1.61	Like he uses I-20 right?
577.51	2.52	I don’t know how long his pages I-20.
580.74	4.28	I think I-20 is gonna be something determined at school, right?
586.31	5.12	Yeah, so then he needs a new I-20 when he wants to stay in the country.
593.68	2.13	Did I mention he was an international student?
595.88	1.69	I think I did right, I probably did.
599.56	0.79	Then they have to give him one.
