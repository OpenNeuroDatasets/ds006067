3.79	5.68	I think that's it again, but I don't really know because my eyesight is really bad.
10.41	4.2	I guess I got that from my parents because both of them also have horrible eyesight.
18.47	2.54	I wonder how far back that goes genetically.
23.71	2.88	I mean, I have no idea how my ancestors survived.
27.63	5.6	I would definitely have died if I was in the wild, because I can't see anything.
35.73	1.96	I should get new glasses again soon.
40.73	3.2	I'd probably go to General Optics.
45.23	2.92	I love the woman there, she's so nice.
50.19	2.7	Except she tried to stab my eyes out with contacts.
54.19	1.06	But she's still very nice.
58.35	0.5	Man, it reminds me of high school.
62.33	1.78	It's been a while since high school.
66.85	2.07	Wow, so it's been...
70.37	0.78	With the gap year...
71.69	1.08	That's been two years.
75.35	0.78	That's crazy.
77.61	2.42	Well, I guess I missed part of it too because of COVID.
82.97	2.4	They had really good fries at Angelo's.
90.61	4.96	And Monalisa's, which is now closed, which is very sad.
96.47	1.04	I love that place.
100.05	1.34	I wonder how my friend Skindy's doing.
105.45	1.1	Oh, he's at Northeastern.
106.75	0.74	He's doing fine.
110.31	1.6	Boston must be nice this time of year.
113.33	1.82	And it's mud season, but still.
119.73	2.12	I should talk to my mom and dad more.
122.67	1.04	That's also been a while.
127.69	2.28	I don't know if I should be thinking this much about time.
130.29	1.4	Time's a crazy thing, so.
133.07	0.5	Who knows?
139.93	2.18	Oh, I got a lot of homework to do as well.
144.87	1.16	I'll do it when I get back.
148.29	1.22	Brody's kind of cold.
151.33	1.26	I've already spent a lot of time there.
156.23	1.74	But homework's homework, I guess, so.
162.95	2.18	I think being an engineer will be fun, though.
168.17	1.58	I mean, I got to do what I like doing, so.
170.91	4.48	Just got to put in the work now, and it'll pay off in like three years.
178.17	0.44	It's okay.
178.83	0.5	It's okay.
180.25	0.76	Don't switch pages.
183.03	1.36	I'm actually loving it.
184.91	0.52	Am I, though?
186.73	0.5	I think I am.
187.27	0.48	I think I am.
188.91	1.46	I love the people.
197.79	1.36	Sounds like dubstep in here.
202.57	1.88	This is what I imagine a rave being like.
206.77	0.86	I wonder if they've done that.
207.95	1.22	MRI rave.
215.71	0.4	It's a brain scan of the entire crowd at once.
219.01	0.82	That'd be sick.
221.57	3.72	A lot of the people there probably have jewelry, because it's like a punk thing.
227.27	2.46	Oh, and then the metal spikes get ripped out.
230.47	0.74	Yeah, maybe not.
231.25	1.26	That's a bad idea.
236.55	1.96	They probably have really good food, though.
242.01	2.34	I'm thinking a lot about food and time.
245.49	1.38	Maybe I'm hungry.
249.81	2.86	I could really use a burger.
253.11	2.4	It's been a while since I had one of those.
260.23	2.12	Wild Willy's in Watertown.
262.41	1.36	That's the place I want to go.
264.29	2.66	I went there with my friends after the Grand Canyon hike.
268.81	1.0	That was so fun.
271.09	1.12	That was so pretty, too.
273.79	1.46	And I got ripped from that.
275.37	1.38	That was crazy.
278.95	0.86	I had a great time.
282.79	3.98	Oh, and my mattress deflated, and I had to sleep on the icy ground.
287.39	1.76	I got so sick and cold.
295.53	0.86	I love hikes.
296.51	0.5	I love hikes.
297.03	1.24	They're so fun.
301.65	1.8	Oh, and I probably shouldn't move my head.
304.57	1.4	I'm really trying not to.
311.93	1.64	I wonder if you could just strap my head down.
315.63	3.88	It's probably some ethics violation with that, but if I agree to it, I don't know.
323.27	3.64	Maybe it's kind of kinky for some people, though, so probably not.
332.59	1.68	Why do they make these things so loud?
334.53	2.26	Isn't it just electromagnets?
338.91	1.9	I swear they did this on purpose.
343.29	4.18	This is probably really ignorant, but I feel like I could build a better MRI that's quieter.
349.07	2.22	Like, it'll at least cover the inside of a sound insulation.
354.97	5.26	Maybe they try to make it as uncomfortable as possible so people don't want to do them.
362.37	2.84	It'd be kind of counterintuitive, though, if you're trying to sell MRIs.
370.77	3.18	Maybe this is just a placebo study.
374.41	2.8	It's actually a torture test to see if the limits of human...
377.91	0.04	No.
378.41	0.56	No.
380.19	1.36	I don't think Hopkins could do that.
396.71	0.28	Man, my random thoughts really are wild.
399.27	1.78	Now I just see a gray screen.
402.49	2.36	Mind is blank.
407.31	1.4	What color is gray?
410.87	1.94	It's a mix of black and white.
414.73	3.42	But white is every color, and black is no color.
420.21	2.24	It's like saying it's part of infinity.
427.03	1.9	That's crazy.
437.47	9.68	Me seeing gray means that I can visualize infinity and break it up into parts.
457.65	2.0	I wonder what effect that would have on science.
460.87	2.84	Alex Kim, the guy who sees infinity.
465.87	2.56	Oh, I guess it's not anonymous anymore.
475.07	1.84	That'd also probably affect thermodynamics.
478.03	4.64	Something gravity would be directly related to thermodynamics.
483.95	4.4	Because entropy is random stuff, so the more random stuff gets, the more entropy there is.
489.47	2.96	Which means the more spread out stuff gets, the more entropy there is.
493.83	2.48	But gravity brings everything together, so...
497.29	3.14	Gravity's an anti-entropic force.
503.19	1.94	Maybe I should be a physicist.
505.45	3.46	Although I don't really like physics, but that seems like an important concept.
510.59	2.08	I bet someone's done an equation on it, though.
515.81	4.36	Hey, if you guys use this to discover some new formula, give me some credit.
522.29	3.84	Alex Kim's random-ass thoughts in an MRI machine.
526.35	2.62	Gravity equals negative entropy.
536.65	1.12	I wonder how long it's been.
538.55	2.46	I sense the time is really off in this machine.
544.93	1.24	It's at a concert, right?
546.21	4.42	Like, if this is like a rave, at a concert, time goes by really quick.
551.71	3.22	And here, it does not.
556.19	0.79	Maybe it has.
557.34	1.09	Maybe it's almost ten minutes.
558.43	1.0	I have no idea.
562.23	1.33	This is like holding a plank.
563.92	1.91	Like everything feels longer.
568.21	1.38	Oh, yeah, I should work out again.
569.95	1.42	It's been a while since I worked out.
573.57	1.15	Well, since Wednesday.
575.26	0.67	But still.
585.37	0.12	It's not great.
586.45	1.96	I'm trying really hard to keep my head still.
589.45	3.04	But I kind of have to yell in here to make myself heard on the mic.
593.69	3.82	So that means my jaw moves a lot, which means my head vibrates.
