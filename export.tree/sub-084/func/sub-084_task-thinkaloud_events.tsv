2.2	13.06	So, starting the think loud for 10 minutes, mostly just thinking about how loud it is in here and how unusual of a sensation.
15.53	2.92	I kind of have an itch on my eyes so I've been thinking about that.
21.97	2.09	I'm wondering what I'll do later today.
24.42	5.94	Let's see, I'll probably be a few hours so I might be able to do some schoolwork.
31.68	8.8	Should probably send an email to my preceptor and see how the study went today.
41.24	5.86	Hoping he got some data this time so I can start to write about it a bit.
48.41	5.94	Deadline is approaching and I need to get that done.
55.59	3.21	Also need to apply for some jobs.
61.06	9.57	Quinn's parents are coming to town soon, so there's so much going on and should probably make a reservation for dinner for all of us.
71.99	1.88	I wonder what I'll do for dinner tonight.
74.05	4.13	Maybe we'll go to Safeway and grab some groceries.
79.53	2.59	Maybe some tofu and rice sounds good.
82.58	0.68	And easy.
84.09	2.25	Could probably have that for lunch the rest of the week too.
88.74	6.72	Maybe I'll try to make some orange tofu with some orange zest or something.
95.91	0.66	Sounds good.
97.87	4.48	Should probably also call my mom and see how she's doing today.
104.84	4.58	Let's see, tomorrow is Wednesday so I'll have to go into class.
111.1	4.95	Maybe I'll try to go in at 9 and get some work done.
117.32	3.85	Get some of those things printed that I need to get printed.
125.98	2.08	Maybe Thursday I'll work from home.
129.29	1.47	Maybe I'll go in, I don't know.
132.16	4.17	But I need to do some writing in my thesis.
139.82	1.55	I wonder what I'll do this weekend.
142.45	8.86	Maybe I'll see if Lily wants to do something or maybe I'll work on that sweater that I'm knitting.
155.57	1.13	Hopefully, the weather's nice.
157.19	4.68	It'd be nice if I could like go on a walk or sit outside and read.
162.5	4.67	I need that book that I have on hold to come from the library.
167.56	1.02	I've been waiting forever for that.
170.12	2.04	But maybe I'll just go buy a copy.
178.97	10.65	Later today, maybe I'll try to start that game that Grace suggested or see if she wants to play that with me.
191.84	6.09	I'm going to try to go to bed earlier tonight.
201.65	4.61	Yeah, because I've been going to bed late and pretty tired every day.
207.35	1.77	So, I should probably do that.
209.29	4.75	Maybe I'll try to do a quick 15-minute workout or something before bed.
214.22	0.9	I bet that'll help.
218.2	2.67	I've got to get some groceries today.
220.97	1.99	So, let's see, what do I need?
223.5	5.63	We need chicken, tofu and apples.
231.35	4.58	Maybe it'd be nice if I could get some produce to have around.
238.52	2.99	Maybe I'll make a soup for the week as well.
243.8	1.82	Maybe just like a vegetable soup.
246.43	3.24	Some broth and some whatever veggies I have around.
254.53	8.28	I wonder if Lily would want to do something maybe Thursday night or Friday night.
263.35	1.0	Or maybe Gilbert.
264.67	1.43	We could see about that.
266.28	3.37	He also wanted to learn how to make my pizza dough recipe.
269.83	5.85	So, maybe I'll have him over to do that and I can show him how to make that.
275.95	0.54	That could be fun.
280.53	2.68	Maybe I'll go see Quinn at work after this.
283.48	8.75	Maybe I'll grab my book and my laptop and do some work at the brewery while he's finishing up work.
296.4	7.53	I'm starting to not really notice the sound, but now that I'm thinking about it I'm hearing it again.
306.88	5.21	And I'm actually surprised by how comfortable it is in here.
315.4	2.57	But this is kind of weird.
318.15	6.42	I never expected I'd be getting an MRI, but it's pretty cool.
330.67	3.76	I'm missing a meeting today.
334.61	2.3	I wonder if I'll miss anything important.
338.17	4.33	They said they'd record it for me, so maybe I'll watch that back later today too.
344.63	6.44	I think they're going to be talking about our conference trip, maybe like the hotel, the flights, and everything.
351.23	1.74	I'll probably have to get the flights for that soon.
355.56	1.53	They're so expensive right now.
357.69	1.09	Hopefully, that'll go down.
361.54	7.71	They'll probably also talk about the AMI Salon, so I should probably start thinking about what I want to submit for that.
371.93	8.43	Maybe I'll do my surgical piece I did, and maybe I'll do my thesis project.
380.82	0.86	That'd probably be good.
383.58	7.47	Yeah, so I'm trying to think about...
392.47	6.94	They'll also probably talk about the Student Exchange in April, so I think we'll be going down to Georgia for that.
400.14	0.81	That'll be fun.
404.72	1.58	Probably only be a couple days.
408.39	2.68	It's going to be a busy couple months till graduation.
411.79	1.68	I can't believe that's coming so soon.
418.31	3.94	Now I'm once again thinking about applying for jobs.
423.34	3.77	I wonder if I'll hear back soon about that one I applied for.
429.33	4.86	I should probably apply for that other animator one that came up today.
434.5	5.4	I'm not sure if that's really what I want to do, but maybe it'll be worth applying anyway.
441.75	7.3	Just from the experience and everything, I feel like it would be a great opportunity, but I don't really know.
449.47	1.08	It's hard to tell.
455.36	3.58	Yeah, I think it's kind of nice out today.
459.4	2.35	Maybe I'll take a walk or something.
461.98	4.31	Maybe I'll walk down and grab a coffee at Charmed.
468.38	2.85	I could probably use some bread too, so maybe I'll pick up some bread from there.
473.46	4.58	Maybe I'll try to take a nice long walk around the park or something.
479.99	2.08	That'll probably feel good.
485.65	2.41	I forgot that pilates class coming up.
488.97	1.22	Well, no, actually, that's...
491.19	2.04	I couldn't get in until the beginning of March.
493.27	4.27	I wonder if they have an opening for sooner, because that would be fun.
498.17	10.57	I thought I wouldn't like it, but tried it recently and it was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
510.51	1.27	Grace went with me.
512.23	8.35	She's always down to do anything, and maybe she'll go with me again.
522.43	5.81	I need to bring Quinn down to that new Spice & Tea store, because that place was cool.
528.42	1.18	I feel like she would enjoy it.
531.73	2.54	Maybe we'll do that this weekend.
536.43	1.86	Yeah, I think that's what we'll do.
543.21	18.18	Yeah, now I'm just thinking about the machine again, noticing the sound again, and just trying to think of something else while I'm in here.
563.61	11.48	I guess my birthday's coming up in a few weeks over spring break, so a lot of people will be out of town, but I know Lily and Grace will be in town, so maybe we'll do something.
577.94	8.35	I think maybe Quinn and I will go get coffee in the morning, and then maybe we'll go have some dinner.
587.42	1.09	Maybe I'll go to Marta.
589.06	4.8	I got some reservations for that, so that should be fun.
594.04	5.31	And then maybe I'll go to the wine bar or something with Grace and Lily after that.
599.8	0.67	It sounds nice.
