4.83	4.59	So, await has a couple of different meanings to it.
11.54	14.97	It can mean to wait for a period of time, or if it's spelled differently, I suppose you could also think about how [weight] is also a size of something.
27.75	4.53	The other day I was performing at a hospital with my friend, Andres.
32.5	14.62	And he's from Colombia, so he doesn't speak English very well, so sometimes whenever I say words that have multiple meanings, I have to specify which meaning that I mean.
51.96	3.25	I wonder what I'm going to get for lunch after this.
57.29	1.73	If I go home, I could cook.
59.74	4.72	I have some teriyaki chicken in my freezer that I can make with some white rice.
65.74	2.12	I wonder what my dog is doing at my apartment.
68.75	3.67	He's probably just asleep on my couch waiting for me to get back.
74.14	8.55	I thought about putting a camera in my apartment just so I can see what he gets up to whenever I'm not home, but I've never done it.
82.76	2.23	I would imagine that he just sleeps the entire time.
85.88	5.81	Sometimes whenever I leave my apartment, he's in the same spot that he's in whenever I get back.
92.93	3.48	So, probably just stays there and waits.
97.63	14.59	Sometimes I feel like even if he moves around, he forgets that he has water in his bowl, because whenever I get back, he immediately chugs like half of the water, even though he has access to it throughout the entire day and can drink water.
114.84	0.9	I'm kind of thirsty.
115.97	5.44	Maybe it's because I drank two cups of tea this morning and only a little bit of water.
122.9	5.05	So, maybe I should do a better job at staying hydrated.
129.74	11.32	Tonight, I'm going to see a concert, and there's this guitarist that's coming to play named Stephanie Jones, along with three, maybe four other guitarists.
141.88	7.6	I don't know their work, so I'm hoping that I'll be able to hear more of Stephanie Jones playing than the other guitarists.
150.32	10.35	Not because they may not be as skilled as Stephanie Jones, but just because I'm purchasing a ticket mostly to see her perform.
161.31	5.65	And because she lives in the UK, this might be the only time that I'll ever see her perform in the United States.
167.48	3.11	I think that this is the first time that she's performed in the US.
173.87	14.65	I was buying tickets for the concert previously this week, and the website didn't allow me to purchase tickets in a spot where there would be what they referred to as orphan seats, meaning that there is a seat that was left all by itself.
189.0	9.79	I suppose that this was so that they could avoid having empty gaps in their seats, so that people would be more likely to purchase certain ones.
199.42	20.62	This was a little annoying, because the seat that I wanted to purchase that would have caused the orphan seat was a little bit closer to the front of the stage, but instead, because of their role, I had to purchase seats that were four rows behind them, and on the other side of the auditorium.
221.59	7.35	If I had purchased three seats instead of two seats, then I could have had the seats that were closer to the front, but that's fine, I guess.
230.22	8.81	I'm going with my friend Veronica, and her and I have rehearsal tomorrow at 12 o'clock.
239.9	15.11	This is the first time that I don't have a concert on a Sunday afternoon in about three weeks, so it'll be nice to just have rehearsal tomorrow, and then be able to practice more afterwards or do homework.
255.41	3.08	I have a couple of music theory assignments that I need to get caught up on.
259.77	8.31	They were due this past Friday and Monday, but for some reason I decided to practice more instead of doing those assignments.
269.03	9.63	I'm glad that this professor doesn't have a late policy where she would deduct points, although that's not always the best thing.
278.73	4.38	Maybe if she did have a late policy where she would deduct points, I would have done the assignment on time.
283.99	8.7	I wonder if other people in the class do the same thing, where they might get a couple of assignments behind and then catch up, or maybe everyone else is more on top of things than I am.
293.66	3.35	I often think that, but that's normally not the case.
297.35	6.13	Most of the time people are just as behind as I am in several of my classes.
305.18	2.69	So that's probably happening in this music theory class too.
309.81	2.69	I have my friend Ben in that class, who sits next to me.
313.75	2.93	Although we don't really get the chance to talk too much throughout class.
317.4	12.97	In front of me, my friend Andres sits there, and he has a lot of hair, so whenever he has it down, I have to sort of crane my head around him in order to see the material that's on the whiteboard.
332.78	2.95	It's a nice head of hair, but it's just a lot and sort of gets in the way.
336.24	9.73	I suppose that if I were to change seats, I wouldn't have to crane my head around him, but the only other seats are in the front of the class, and I prefer to be in the middle row or maybe even the back row.
349.01	5.25	After I go to music theory on Monday, I wonder what I'm doing after that.
356.38	4.93	Probably going to go back to my apartment and practice, because I don't have any other classes after that.
362.22	10.34	And I don't have any lessons that I'm teaching that evening either, so I suppose that I could spend most of the late afternoon evening getting some work done and preparing for my recital that's in May.
374.82	4.24	This Friday I have another concert where me and my friend Maddie will be performing.
379.55	1.1	Maddie plays the flute.
381.53	5.4	We're supposed to be playing a couple of duets together, but neither of us have texted each other about what duets we'd like to play.
388.74	2.21	So, I should probably do that after this, actually.
391.07	6.46	She said that she has an audition today, and that after her audition she would look into the pieces that she would like to perform together.
398.7	1.33	I should do that sooner than later,
400.29	6.86	because I am also preparing about 30 minutes of other pieces for that concert that's on Friday.
411.5	1.43	What else am I doing throughout this week?
415.36	1.55	I can't think of anything specifically.
416.96	2.97	I have a pretty normal week of lessons.
420.43	4.08	Oh, although this Wednesday my girlfriend will be visiting from San Antonio.
425.61	8.76	This Friday is our three year anniversary, and it's also St. Paddy's Day, so I think that we'll go to an Irish pub and celebrate.
436.79	6.94	She's Irish, she actually has her Irish citizenship, and plays Irish folk music on the fiddle.
445.52	2.92	Although she doesn't practice very often, she mostly just plays for fun.
450.51	11.27	Sometimes she will bring her fiddle whenever she visits me, and will perform for the residents at the retirement home that I'm a musician resident at.
462.4	5.15	But she hasn't done that since last spring, so I don't think that she'll be doing that during this visit.
469.66	20.34	The residents enjoy her playing, and even think that she goes to Peabody because she's able to keep up with me, even though she doesn't think too highly of her playing, because it's not classical playing, it's folk playing, which in itself has its own unique skills that are required in order to be proficient at playing folk music.
491.43	1.72	On my recital I'm playing an Irish song.
493.38	1.79	Actually, I'm playing a couple of Irish songs.
497.03	1.44	One of them I'm not very good at.
499.36	0.99	Two others I'm pretty good at.
500.39	5.65	I should really work on the third piece, because that concert will be coming up fairly soon.
508.37	7.76	After I give that recital, I only have a couple more weeks left in the semester, and I'll be on summer vacation after that.
516.18	3.98	Although I guess it's not really summer vacation if this is my last semester and I'm graduating.
520.95	1.13	I suppose it's just summer.
524.42	3.28	I should figure out what I'm going to do for employment.
527.75	3.82	If I move back to San Antonio, there aren't a lot of job opportunities.
531.62	6.69	I feel like if I want to get a full-time position, more than likely I'll have to move out of San Antonio.
539.74	9.21	There's a job in Colorado that I could apply for and be an arts administrator and run programs for local music programs.
550.93	3.94	That sounds appealing, I think I would enjoy the work, but I don't know if I want to move to Colorado.
556.02	6.84	My girlfriend and I talked about moving to a different state the year after I graduate, so I guess that's coming up pretty soon.
564.52	5.65	The reason for that move is so that we can live together whenever I'm working on my doctorate.
571.2	6.91	So, I should probably narrow down the choices of universities that I plan on applying to for that degree.
580.68	4.6	If I end up applying for Peabody and going to Peabody again, I think that'd be nice.
586.18	9.55	Although after being gone from Baltimore for a year, I will have lost my job teaching at Loyola, which pays well.
595.81	6.45	And I enjoy the work because I get to teach guitar to a group of about eight students.
