9.59	13.09	Okay um the first thing on my mind like the biggest thing is that I’m feeling a little bit silly here in this um little little contraption.
22.7	4.05	I feel like I’m very uh locked in here, stationary, not in a bad way.
26.79	16.45	Just feels a little silly um making sure to also like the whole not moving my head thing and keeping my head in the exact same spot is uh something I have been really trying to be aware of uh.
43.91	10.03	I definitely like wasn’t expecting it to be quite this noisy, but it’s not like in a bad way or anything.
54.95	16.32	Um yeah I guess I didn’t know what to expect before coming in here and this is I don’t wanna say its not what I expected because I didn’t expect anything, but it’s definitely interesting and different um.
71.31	14.35	It doesn’t feel like I’m in a uh in like a tube at all cause like all I can see is an opening to a tube so it feels totally fine, not like I’m confined or anything um.
86.75	5.31	I was talking to my mom about like what this was gonna be like cause she’s had one.
93.28	5.36	She like couldn’t give me any kind of useful description whatsoever.
99.52	7.76	It was kind of weird, I still didn’t know what I was gonna be expecting.
108.08	6.3	I don’t know, but here I am I’m still totally fine and um I’m feeling like I don’t know.
115.27	4.92	I feel like this is like a helpful thing for me to be doing um.
121.24	8.77	And it’s like also like kind of interesting to think that like there’s a machine taking pictures of my brain right now as I have these thoughts um.
131.72	10.33	I don’t know I just think that the sort of progression of the science involved is interesting um.
144.91	21.71	It’s very very I don’t know similar exactly to the science that I think about or I do, but I feel like there are definite similarities between sort of you just keep progressing.
168.05	14.73	Where like you do an experiment, you do a new study, you do a new survey, and then you analyze those results that data and it helps push the field forward.
182.85	2.78	Helps come up with new conclusions.
185.78	5.87	Helps come up with new like ideas, where, helps before the understanding.
193.25	38.17	It’s probably like a large reason I feel like I like science and was drawn to it as a field I want to be a part of because you can like all that you can do is keep progressing and those progressions can sort of be major or minor, but that’s the I don’t know the kind of work that I think is going to be something that I find fulfilling uh yeah.
233.27	19.78	Uh all day I have been probably for 3 or 4 hours or so before uh going up campus, I was reading uh cosmology and nongalactic astrophysics papers and basically all I’ve done today.
253.9	5.34	And um yeah I’m a big science kid right now, I guess.
260.13	28.62	Um cause its really interesting, I always like reading those papers, makes me feel like I’m, I don’t know real, a real scientist, real personative field, really there contributing to scientific development, progression and like fields are so different and the papers that I’m reading are all so different, but like all of science gets moved forward.
288.86	21.16	I just think it’s really uh, I think uh meeting on tomorrow actually with uh my PI, it’s gonna be the first time I’m meeting him in person cause I started working in this lab um when last spring when we were still virtual.
310.17	8.21	I’ve been on zoom calls with him countless times and I know what he looks like, I know who he’s like, but I just never met him in person before so.
319.46	3.34	I don’t think I’m nervous for it, but it’ll be interesting.
323.45	2.86	He’s a really great guy mostly, I love him um.
326.89	8.69	He’s like a really nice sort of mentor type for me in the field and I appreciate it, but yeah.
335.68	1.2	I gotta finish reading his papers.
336.94	2.73	I have more papers to read when I get home uh.
355.34	1.34	I have a poker night later tonight.
357.28	2.46	Some of my friends are coming over to my new house uh.
360.96	2.69	We are having a sort of poker night thing.
365.07	6.3	My uh roommate just flew in from California yesterday night.
372.39	15.29	He has been in California since the pandemic started since we got kicked off of campus March of last year and so I haven’t seen him in person in 15 months.
388.67	4.17	He’s a really good friend of mine, so I’m super happy for him to be back uh.
393.74	2.38	Got to spend last night with him uh.
397.25	7.33	Yeah its really nice, he’s a really good guy and um it was pretty enjoyable um.
406.44	11.52	We're having a poker night thing tonight and he’s really into poker and so I’m hoping that he will play a little bit more seriously with me than all of other friends who aren’t quite as much into it.
421.37	1.15	Uh yeah it will be a good time.
422.59	3.03	The last time we tried to have one of these poker night things it was super fun.
429.26	9.31	And uh it was also a little bit fun because I was teaching everyone and then we playing and I’m better at just like understand the game a little bit more.
438.73	5.35	I have more experience playing it and who doesn’t like to be good at something when they’re doing it with people um.
447.44	1.69	Yeah had a good time with that.
450.18	1.44	Uh that’ll be happening later tonight.
451.68	7.48	I made up a facebook event invite for it for the first time I ever made a facebook event.
459.98	2.63	It was really funny I thought I did a really good job on it um.
465.5	9.32	The I did it while we were at a trivia night type thing um.
476.13	1.88	That was super fun I don’t like.
478.81	12.53	I had never been to like a trivia night thing before, but I really had a good time and uh it was suggested by one of our friends and we all went there.
491.51	0.36	Where was it.
492.1	3.82	It was some place in Towson, I don’t remember where it was.
496.73	13.68	It was really fun and uh I like trivia cause I feel like I have random knowledge and when you have like random knowledge and it just like something hits it, it’s really satisfying and feel very justified in having that knowledge.
512.52	9.92	Um I feel like very interesting sensation right now where I’m like swimming, I don’t know how to describe it.
523.6	1.45	It’s kind of fun, kind of weird.
525.69	1.25	I kind of like it in this machine.
528.36	2.76	I hope I’m doing a decent enough job keeping my head still.
531.15	9.68	I’m trying not to move too much, but yeah the uh the machine has it’s kind of crazy, I’m having a good time.
542.01	6.74	So, I feel very comfortable like my ears are being very comfortably held here.
549.9	8.06	I see uh what that little uh prompt meant about any bodily sensations you might feel, briefly describe them.
557.97	3.94	So I am currently having that experience.
573.0	3.17	This weekend I’m gonna go to brunch on Saturday.
576.81	5.11	Try the new busboys and poets place right by uh campus, that’ll be a good time.
582.8	3.11	I’m going kayaking on Sunday uh.
587.06	7.94	It’s been a couple weeks since I been kayaking and its gonna be on a new river, so this is all very exciting stuff um.
597.14	13.47	I decided to do more kayaking this summer oh it stopped talking, but um I am yeah excited to do more oh things changing.
