18.3	3.15	I feel like a little more claustrophobic than it already is.
27.11	3.54	I guess it's going to sound like this for the next three hours.
32.74	2.31	Like I don't feel uncomfortable, so it's good.
41.53	1.94	Maybe I'll get a coffee after this.
45.65	4.46	Could go to Belvedere Square or someplace down here.
55.25	4.21	I think it's going to be warm today, 'cause it's going to be a warm Thursday.
64.65	2.87	Maybe like 60 degrees, 70 degrees.
69.58	1.38	Could walk down to the water.
75.44	2.25	I'm still just going to pick Mia up to go to H Mart.
80.55	3.86	I don't know what time she's thinking of going next.
86.2	2.05	I have to lesson-plan for tomorrow
91.96	1.58	and go to the restaurant store.

164.03	2.6	I don't know if I should stay over with them anymore
168.86	6.87	Pack at night, we're going to leave at 10 a.m. Friday.
185.88	11.16	It's really hard to think with the scan going on, although it's a kind of chat.
213.37	2.96	Don't really have any thoughts with all this white noise.
234.33	2.49	I just have song lyrics going through my head.
243.26	5.89	That odd song that's likeâ€“ who sings it?
255.77	10.99	Maybe I'll just say how it went viral at the very beginning of COVID.
266.98	2.65	I hate how the microphone keeps touching my lip.
271.98	1.53	It makes me not want to talk.
297.67	1.83	I don't know, I'm not having any thoughts.
310.83	1.52	The act is kind of uncomfortable.
317.93	1.79	I feel like I'm in an airplane.
335.58	5.95	I wonder how long kids have to be in here when they get their scans.

396.61	2.5	Maybe I can stop at like a FedEx or something.
400.79	2.25	I'll probably go all the way to Charles Village, then.
405.09	1.41	Maybe there's one at Belvedere Square
406.52	1.42	when I go to urgent care later.
409.27	2.36	Oh, this microphone keeps touching my lip.
414.58	1.04	I'm really uncomfortable.
430.25	4.47	Back of my head's kind of itchy, I really want to go to sleep.
