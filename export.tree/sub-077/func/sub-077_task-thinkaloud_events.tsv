5.09	6.82	So, my name is Cesar, and I'm here today for the MRI scan.
12.19	7.38	And a few of my friends also wanted to come but they had to go through the screening first I said to them.
20.17	3.0	Probably they will be interested for the next time.
24.43	9.88	Tomorrow I'm going with my friends to do some shopping because a few of them are going back to India to meet their families.
34.83	3.3	So, they wanted to do some shopping.
38.95	8.16	And I told them it's not possible for today, maybe tomorrow I can join them and I can go with them to buy a few stuff for myself as well.
47.83	4.1	Because I'm also thinking to go home at some point in the next couple of months time.
52.51	2.3	So, probably that shopping will help me as well.
56.53	2.52	I was also watching cricket yesterday.
59.33	3.02	It was a good game between Australia and India.
63.39	1.42	India won the game finally.
65.31	4.08	It was good bowling performance from the Indian side, especially Ravindra Jadeja.
70.19	5.92	He took like 5 wickets in the first innings, and I think two or three wickets in the second innings.
76.45	2.66	And it really ripped off Australia's wickets.
79.85	7.64	Along with Ravindra Jadeja, there was Aswin, who also performed really well with the bat as well as with the ball.
88.33	4.96	And from the Aussie side, it's Labhushani and Todd Murphy.
93.99	3.58	Those were the two players who stood out and did really well for their country.
98.21	2.54	But unfortunately, they had to lose the game at the end.
100.89	6.88	And it was really good for me to watch it last night because it was Friday evening, I wanted something to relax.
107.99	3.2	And it was a really good game, and finally India won that.
111.61	5.64	I think the second test match starts sometime in next week, I think.
117.25	0.98	I'm not sure about the date.
118.97	2.46	But I would definitely wait for it.
121.79	3.2	And let's see how it goes for both the teams.
126.29	3.84	And whomsoever wins, I think they will qualify for the World Championship.
130.61	5.58	And I hope this time India qualifies because last time they qualified, but unfortunately they lost it in the finals.
136.65	7.38	And this time if they qualify, I would really pray for them to win the finals and bring honors for the country.
148.95	1.64	It's been a lovely day so far today.
151.07	2.56	Good weather, sunny, clear sky.
153.81	3.4	But I think the weather is dropping down to 3 degree in the evening.
157.95	3.82	I'm thinking to go to the rec center to play some badminton with my friends.
162.69	4.14	Let's see what time I'm finishing with the current job here.
167.17	8.86	If it finishes soon, then probably I'll go back home and take some rest, have some food and go around 5 or 6 to a rec center.
176.49	4.56	If it takes longer, then probably I'll miss it today and wait for tomorrow sometime.
181.35	5.66	If the shopping finishes soon, then I'll go to the rec center in the evening.
188.03	2.58	That's all about my routine.
191.13	5.4	It was nice talking to Arthur this morning, just before the scanning of MRI.
196.85	4.16	He was giving me some inspiration about how to do for residencies.
201.63	8.38	He was talking about his dad, how he did his residency at a late stage but still found it right.
210.05	4.68	He's now a doctor in San Francisco, California.
215.05	1.82	So, it really inspired me a lot.
218.87	4.1	And I think it is one of the inspiration stories for me to think.
223.97	5.3	And if I want to move ahead from research to residencies, I can do it at some point.
230.21	9.06	Let's see, but it was really nice of Arthur to give me this inspiration, and sharing some of his family stories to cheer me up.
240.69	9.26	I was also asking Hannah whether she is going to the badminton rec center, but she said she's going rarely.
250.41	5.36	It's not that frequent, but I think I saw her once or twice, so I don't remember exactly.
260.15	0.16	But I may be wrong.
262.97	0.08	Food, yeah.
265.91	10.48	I'm thinking I'll go and cook some lentil soup tonight because the temperature is dropping down, and some warm soup would be really good for dinner.
277.27	14.81	And along with that, some veggie tortilla wraps with green beans and chickpeas with some avocados and ranch sauce.
292.08	1.85	That would be good, I think.
294.95	3.62	Maybe with some rice on the side.
298.69	2.1	I'm not sure if I can cook the rice.
301.89	1.12	Let's see how hungry I am.
308.67	0.44	If I get enough time to cook, I will cook it.
310.73	2.98	I have to buy some tomatoes tomorrow.
315.87	1.54	Yes, I'll keep it for tomorrow.
318.05	8.5	Tomatoes, onions, and maybe a few lettuce.
330.79	2.92	Apples I have, fruits, what else I can think of?
336.23	1.38	Pineapples and papaya.
337.99	1.32	I love papaya.
340.51	2.14	Maybe I can take some papaya this time.
343.01	1.9	It's been a long time I've tried papaya.
345.97	2.32	The ripened one, of course.
349.01	2.34	It tastes really good.
354.55	1.32	About my research.
356.05	6.36	Well, I've been to lab this morning quickly and started up the machine for micro CT.
362.99	6.14	Once this finishes, I will go back again to check if the machine has done the job, what I'm expecting.
370.03	1.48	I put it on scan.
371.67	2.78	It will take for roughly two to three hours, I think so.
375.77	4.14	By the time I finish this MRI scan, I think that should be done.
385.31	0.56	And it's only one sample, so I don't think it will take that long.
388.65	3.44	And on Tuesday meeting, probably I will be able to show the data.
392.39	1.6	I have to analyze it, of course.
394.17	2.7	But tomorrow it's not possible since I'm going out.
398.35	4.66	Monday morning, I can come a little bit early and do the analysis.
403.93	2.36	And that should be ready for Tuesday meeting.
406.51	2.54	And I can discuss with Janet about this.
409.67	8.52	If she's allowed me to present in the upcoming conference, which is going to be held in Buenos Aires in Argentina in March.
418.95	4.08	If she's okay with it, then probably I have to include this in the slides.
423.41	3.25	And that will be really good to present.
426.66	6.19	And I will expect some good comments from the peers in the conference and some suggestions as well.
432.91	1.3	What I can do next.
434.73	3.02	Or if there's something wrong, then how can I modify it?
437.83	3.9	How can I make it stronger to be getting published?
442.67	9.0	I think this would be really nice if Janet agrees to put this on my conference slides in next month.
452.67	1.32	The flight tickets are booked.
455.19	2.12	We just need to make sure about the hotels.
457.95	3.47	I think Kay is looking after the hotels.
461.42	3.33	She will get back to us next week sometime.
465.65	4.3	Hopefully, she'll be looking for two different rooms.
471.49	2.7	One for me, one for Aaryan.
475.25	4.34	Because still I think the conference guidelines says we have to follow the COVID guidelines.
479.69	1.82	We cannot share the rooms.
482.43	4.26	It's better to obvious social distancing.
487.47	3.06	I think, yeah, that will be good.
490.67	5.5	And probably we have enough funding in the project to sponsor two hotel rooms for three nights.
496.21	1.84	I think that should be fine.
498.75	6.52	And that's good, I think.
507.73	2.84	I think this is already 10 minutes, but still going on.
510.57	0.9	I'm not sure.
511.55	1.94	Let's see how long it goes.
514.75	4.56	Maybe I've already done with six, seven minutes at least.
521.15	1.7	Let's wait and check.
523.93	5.18	I don't know what else I can think of right now.
532.95	4.54	Oh, yeah, about my friend's printout instructions.
537.57	1.22	Oh, that was funny.
539.31	2.74	So, one of my friend asked me to take some printouts today.
542.95	1.12	I went to the lab.
544.47	1.22	He sent me some documents.
546.31	1.58	Unfortunately, they are not opening.
547.93	1.96	I don't know in what file format they were.
550.49	3.68	So, I asked him to send me again.
554.73	3.1	And he's struggling to convert the file formats.
558.45	2.04	I've never seen those kind of file formats before.
561.07	4.34	It is something like GZH.
565.73	3.7	I don't know what file format that stands for.
570.23	13.98	Yeah, I hope he will be changing it to either Word or PPT formats so that I can take a print, or maybe at least a JPEG or PNG so that makes my life easy to take printout.
584.69	1.72	He is working on it right now.
587.77	6.24	I'll wait for his email to arrive and let's see if that helps me to take prints.
595.47	1.82	Otherwise, he has to find some other solution.
