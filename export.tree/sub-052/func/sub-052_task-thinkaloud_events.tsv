157.29	13.9	And the stuff that's gonna take them longest time is introduction and discussion, which I can do much... Which I can do next week also, because that's gonna take time anyways, and I may have to talk to Dr Sprague and discuss a little bit with him.
172.5	5.43	And about the tickets, I will have to talk to some agent because tickets are pretty expensive right now.
177.96	4.93	So I need to call some agent and see if they have any cheaper tickets to India.
183.46	7.29	I should be picking my tickets soon because it's only one and a half month, less than one and a half month in my trip.
191.9	6.63	I have to talk to Dr. Sprague and ask him if I can take two weeks off for, for the wedding.
199.41	2.72	And what about my Visa appointment?
202.41	2.56	Oh, oh, my visa appointment is on 17th,
205.01	14.06	so that mean I'm gonna have to leave on the Valentine's Day's night or maybe 15 morning if I can find an early morning flight, maybe I can find an early morning flight I'm not sure.
219.45	10.91	It's gonna be tight, I have to be in India by 17 morning anyhow, because my appointment is 17 afternoon, and then I get there on 17, wedding is on 21.
230.51	3.52	So I have, like, five days to do my wedding shopping in India.
235.71	2.88	But I might not get... That might not be enough time.
239.96	12.65	So what I can do is I can get started on some online shopping from here and I can order some stuff and when I get there, I can try to get everything done.
254.23	7.33	But I don't have... I have to be in India from 17th to 28th.
262.75	4.81	The conference is on fourth, so I have to be back in US by 1st maximum.
268.43	8.2	And then I, I will have three days, two days actually to get acclimatized, and then leave for Louisiana on 4th.
278.08	4.14	Okay, that can be done maybe, I don't know.
282.33	10.57	It's gonna be super rough on my body, like, changing time zones back to back, but I'm presenting on the 5th, 5th of March.
293.2	2.94	So I have to prepare my posters.
296.34	11.18	I have to prep... Get everything sorted and reach Louisiana by 4th morning or 3rd night so that I can present the paper on 5th.

338.23	1.79	So take that one off.

346.32	2.99	Three weeks I have to finish the submission.
350.96	13.19	If everyone gets, gives me their reviews and comments by January beginning, or January first two weeks, then I might be able to submit those papers by the end of January or beginning of Feb.
365.21	6.46	That's perfect because I have to finish all of this before leaving for India, that's in February, second week.
373.44	8.92	Alright, so the next six weeks I have to be on my toes and I have to finish all of that work if I wanna go back home and enjoy the wedding.

391.7	8.89	At least I can get three... Okay, I can get these two papers out by January and, like, my part is finished.
400.99	19.91	It's just I have been waiting for these people to, like, my clinical group to tell me their comments, and if they find it fine then it's gonna be just minor changes or, like, a few questions here and there, and I'm gonna answer that... Oh, that reminds me, what about MU paper?

520.82	14.14	We might not have meetings, so I'm gonna ask Dr. Sprague tonight when I call him, I'm gonna ask him if we are even having this meeting this week or not, because it would be fine if they could just cancel it.
535.38	8.78	It's just another stressful thing, I don't wanna present this week, I just wanna finish all my papers and all my case reports by this week.
545.87	3.5	Uh, my God, it's looking stressful.

575.5	9.56	Uh, but that's fine, that's fine, umm, if I can get tickets under 1200 that would be great.
