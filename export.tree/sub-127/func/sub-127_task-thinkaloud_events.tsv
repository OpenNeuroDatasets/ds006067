3.98	15.47	Today, I was thinking about the desert with this image and how I was going to live in Kuwait a few years ago, when I was engaged.
20.82	4.72	So, it just reminded me how my life would have been in the Middle East.
27.24	7.01	Then as he said, he's my friend here and he was born in Oman.
37.23	7.41	As much as I disassociate the Middle East with my new life, it's interesting to see how it still loops.
46.07	2.5	I've made some really good friends while I've been here,
50.24	2.98	and it's just so fabulous at the school.
54.63	11.68	When I think about my mom back in Oregon, it's hard to see her being sad about me being here.
67.06	5.13	You know, she has black hair, she's getting a little older in life.
73.08	6.79	And I can just feel right now, the breeze of the room going through my body,
79.93	7.29	and I wonder if it's really that cold outside or if it's just this room.
89.4	6.7	It's been a while since I've been in an MRI machine, probably like five, six years.
98.39	6.8	You know, back then, I lived in Seattle and it was a really pretty city with a lot of lights.
107.22	3.92	I fell asleep a lot of the time when I was in an MRI machine, I'm pretty sure.
114.45	9.43	When I lived in Seattle, I lived with my best friend and we had an apartment that was next to a lot of trees.
124.71	2.12	The trees were really tall and green.
128.59	5.03	It used to rain a lot and I love the rain.
134.36	5.27	One time, it snowed really, really big.
140.83	5.26	It's colder here in this room than when it had snowed.
148.75	8.91	You know, my cousin, Vanessa, she has been so sad and I don't know how to help her.
160.17	4.91	She lives in Mexico and she doesn't like her job.
166.5	1.17	She's my older cousin.
169.0	11.35	She's the oldest of six of us and it's always been really impressive to see how she has been growing up, and it's so interesting to see her sad.
181.85	2.42	She looks a lot like my mom, physically.
185.82	4.49	It's funny when I think about it, because I am supposed to be the one who looks like my mom.
191.38	1.24	I look like my dad though.
196.31	3.86	My dad died a few years back.
201.87	0.75	He had a stroke.
204.5	2.12	He probably had an MRI done.
208.38	6.24	I wonder if he thought of anything while he was in this machine or if he also just fell asleep.
219.22	4.6	My brother is in the military.
224.92	10.47	And this little cross on the screen, I don't know, it looks white and it looks like it's bouncing.
236.13	5.53	Am I moving too much or is it just the way that I'm blinking?
243.74	1.92	I used to work for the Red Cross.
247.04	1.94	I have got some really good friends there.
252.17	5.14	When I see crosses, I can't help but think about that.
259.63	2.14	Wow, it's still cold in this room.
264.05	3.41	My shoulders can feel it the most.
268.42	8.35	And the sound from the machine, it's so soothing, to be honest.
280.32	10.97	It should make me more anxious because it's constant and loud, but the consistency is quite nice.
294.21	4.42	I wonder how it would be like to go on a run right now.
300.44	2.45	I think the weather outside is pretty good.
306.12	2.42	I was having a good time walking here.
309.88	9.56	And my class, my teacher is getting deported in a month, the class that I just had.
320.69	2.83	And she was a really good teacher, I guess she still is.
325.51	2.34	I wonder if I'll ever see her again.
330.15	2.11	She is from New York.
332.53	2.54	Well, her husband is from New York,
335.71	1.33	and I just went to New York
337.08	1.59	and it was such a lovely city.
339.31	10.58	It was my first time there and I got to see the big, tall buildings and all the pretty lights, and it reminded me a lot of Mexico City.
351.67	5.57	Like the smell of the fish in the streets, I don't know, it was really fun.
358.8	1.54	Aldrin came with me.
361.38	4.19	Aldrin is my friend and he has a lot of scars on his face.
367.52	2.25	I don't know from what.
370.74	11.03	I know he had a hard life before and I know he doesn't talk about them a lot, but when I see his face, it's just so scarred.
384.05	14.52	And when I think about the scars, I can't help but think about my middle school and when I told a girl that I thought her scar was really cool.
400.19	8.76	She cried because she thought I was pointing it out to everybody, but I just was curious.
408.99	0.8	I was so young.
411.02	10.51	So, when I see Aldrin's scars, I don't say anything because I don't want him to think that I'm pointing them out or saying something mean.
423.51	11.61	I don't know if that's a normal thing, but I guess I have scars too on my face and I just thought it was normal.
436.9	4.48	The little cross is still bouncing.
443.46	5.71	It's so weird because I know I am not moving, but why is the cross moving on the screen?
451.83	0.97	Time is weird.
454.4	3.59	It feels like it's been so long in here.
460.72	4.52	My feet really feel tingly
465.28	3.49	and I feel like a run would be so nice,
469.87	3.56	but I can't go on a run after this because I have to go to the aquarium.
474.57	2.67	I'm excited to see the fish though.
478.96	1.32	It'll be my first time there.
481.68	2.66	I haven't been to the aquarium in a long time.
485.44	4.72	I know I won't see a whale, but a whale would be really cool.
491.75	1.41	I really like dolphins.
494.13	4.79	Just the ocean in general seems so calming and soothing.
499.0	7.2	I see the waves at the beach, and the sun is just so warm.
510.15	2.47	I guess in Oregon, the beaches are cold though,
513.22	6.16	but I still get into the water because it's soothing to just feel the waves upon you.
520.83	3.02	I usually wear a wetsuit though when I go.
524.95	5.28	I learned how to surf a few years back ago and it was really fun.
531.99	6.86	I learned to surf at my community college when I was in high school, which I think is funny now
538.92	6.57	because I then went back to that community college to get my pre-reqs for nursing.
546.9	25.5	It's an odd way of life that I've been doing because, I mean, full circle, there's no way I would have ever thought that I would be here in an MRI machine, looking at a little cross, thinking how old I am and wondering why this sound is fluctuating more right now.
573.44	5.2	The sound seems to have gotten faster, but I don't think that's the case.
579.77	2.02	How am I just noticing it more now?
587.89	4.17	You know, the little cross, it's like it's dancing
593.1	2.47	and I do really like to dance.
597.59	2.51	I'm not very good at it, but like...
