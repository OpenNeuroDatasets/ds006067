2.06	11.97	Okay, well to start I could talk about how really weird it is to hear my voice like this because I'm talking out loud but it doesn't sound like I'm talking that loud so I'm not sure how loud I'm actually talking.
17.71	2.41	Classes tomorrow, I have homework to do for them.
20.65	7.02	I need to remember to do that assignment for cell bio and then I have to remember to turn in that one paper.
28.08	4.21	It's not really a paper, it's just like a certificate but that's not really important.
33.2	2.0	Today, I still have to go...
36.17	1.86	I need to make sure my dance costume is dry.
39.23	0.79	I need to wash it.
40.22	0.99	No, it's washed already.
41.45	5.71	I need to make sure it's washed clean because I had to hand dry it and now there's mud on it.
47.88	7.15	Sandy got all of her mud out so I feel like my costume should be clean enough right now but I'm not actually entirely sure.
57.29	1.11	Am I supposed to keep it?
58.59	10.22	I think someone in chat said that maybe we're supposed to keep the costumes because I'm already performing on Friday and I also don't even know where my performance is.
69.43	2.38	I know it's in UMD but no one ever told me where.
72.58	1.18	That's kind of problematic.
74.26	5.5	I should probably message them and try to figure out where and when it is so I don't miss it.
80.83	1.27	That's kind of not good planning.
83.18	1.8	Well, I can have some at practice today.
85.23	1.19	I'm just going to go to practice.
86.99	3.36	Oh, but before practice I have a meeting with Smile.
91.25	1.79	I don't even know what I'm going to do in that meeting.
93.28	5.63	I feel kind of underqualified to be there but somehow I'm there so I'm not really going to complain.
100.07	3.65	I think we need to talk about probably fundraising?
105.07	0.56	I'm not sure.
105.79	1.39	It's my first time doing that.
107.23	0.82	I'm sure they won't mind.
108.12	1.72	They all seem like really nice people anyways.
110.65	7.46	So then after that, I go to dance and then I return my costume and I might stay after dance to do some more performance stuff.
118.49	0.81	That's kind of a lot.
119.34	4.3	I'm not going to be back till like 11 today and then I have to figure out how to eat dinner.
124.86	1.29	What am I going to eat for dinner?
126.59	1.03	I wanted to cook.
127.77	6.55	I only have, let me think, 7 to 8 is my meeting and then dance is at 9.
135.08	2.13	So then 8 to 9 I need to eat.
137.89	1.84	Should I cook something?
140.83	5.43	Or if I cook something, I only have an hour to cook so it's going to have to be fast.
146.91	2.82	I could just always microwave or air fry something.
151.07	7.55	And then I think Tim wanted to join me for dinner too so then I need to cook food for two people or make food or order food actually.
158.98	2.63	Ordering food will probably be the better option.
162.68	4.27	I could get somewhere, I could get something on St. Paul's within an hour.
166.99	0.77	That should be fine.
168.58	4.35	Tim doesn't really like, he doesn't like Doner Bros.
172.98	1.98	We'll probably end up doing And Pizza.
175.75	6.57	I don't really feel like eating pizza though because I had chicken tenders for lunch and I had to eat those really fast and it was raining.
182.38	2.73	It was really sad but I don't really mind.
186.77	2.59	Oh and if I wanted to cook something, I need to go to the grocery store.
190.05	7.97	I could go to the Streets but then I would need to get maybe probably some chicken and tomatoes.
198.55	3.26	I also need to get strawberries because I want to try to make strawberry milk from scratch.
202.38	2.48	I have absolutely no idea how that's going to go.
205.35	5.27	I saw it on TikTok and I just need to re-look at it and figure out the recipe.
211.16	2.08	I've always wanted to try to make strawberry milk from scratch.
215.57	0.98	So I'll probably do that with Tim too.
216.61	1.21	Oh but I only have an hour.
218.55	0.85	That really sucks.
220.09	6.74	Maybe I'll just buy the strawberries because I'm at the grocery market anyways and then I'll just put them in the fridge and save it for later.
228.09	1.44	Is there enough space in my fridge?
231.09	4.04	I also have all the vegetables in my fridge that I haven't used.
235.33	1.34	Maybe I shouldn't go to the market.
236.72	1.69	I think I have too many things in my fridge.
238.97	5.48	If I go to the market, it'll probably be more full and I need to share the space with Kathy in my room.
245.34	2.92	Wait but Kathy is not...
249.33	2.38	She moved out because she's an RA now.
252.26	1.67	I should probably apply to be an RA.
254.68	1.86	I think it's probably too late for that though.
256.58	0.64	Application?
258.19	1.54	Application probably closed.
260.44	1.19	I should look into that.
261.79	1.55	Do I really want to be an RA?
264.28	1.72	I've heard a lot of like bad things.
266.06	4.76	Emma said it was nice but I don't really trust that.
270.87	7.87	There was the other girl who Tim knows and she dropped out of being an RA because she said it was too much work and she didn't have a lot of freedom.
280.04	4.6	Well I think I'll probably be really busy next year.
285.94	1.16	Could I be an RA?
287.48	0.59	I don't think so.
288.31	1.79	Well Kathy's an RA and that's good for her.
290.79	4.03	That means I need to find housing next year that isn't with the school.
297.13	4.87	I think my mom wanted me to be an RA so she didn't have to worry about that.
302.53	4.67	I know I am going to have to worry about that because I'm pretty sure the deadline's passed but I can't remember when.
308.28	1.75	Maybe it was like Monday or something?
311.15	0.41	Not sure.
311.99	0.79	Also I need to...
313.64	2.08	Oh I have a lot to do then to find housing.
315.75	1.52	I need to call the apartments.
317.99	4.31	Aidan said Wyman is probably going to be full but I don't believe that.
322.85	6.78	He said they already filled out but then Kathy was saying that they don't really fill or they don't really even release spots until March.
330.87	2.05	So it doesn't really make sense if they're full right now.
333.75	3.63	So maybe I should call them or maybe I should ask Becky to call them because I hate calling people.
338.05	3.35	I kind of have to do it and I feel bad if I make Becky do everything.
341.6	2.32	I don't think she's really done anything about housing yet.
344.58	0.44	I don't think...
345.3	1.44	I should probably call her.
347.1	0.7	Not call her.
348.29	1.62	Just meet up with her and figure that out.
350.96	3.57	Otherwise where am I going to live next semester?
355.05	1.15	That is a problem.
357.46	2.08	Tim's trying for Remington Row.
360.2	1.48	I wanted to get Wyman Towers.
361.72	1.99	I still want to get Wyman Towers but it's full.
364.3	1.78	If not I'm going to have to go to Remington Row.
367.7	1.61	Remington Row is fine.
369.59	1.14	The only thing is it's kind of far.
370.89	2.06	Do I really want to be taking a bus to school?
373.75	0.81	I guess it's like a walk.
374.88	0.67	Someone...
376.18	0.66	that one guy...
377.4	0.43	what's his name?
378.77	0.47	Alex.
379.27	3.04	Alex said he lived in Remington, behind Remington Row.
382.84	1.4	He said it was a 12 minute walk.
385.18	1.93	I don't even know if I want to be walking that far.
388.38	1.28	Well okay it's 12 minutes.
389.69	1.99	It's not that bad but at night it's going to be bad.
391.71	2.84	When it's raining or snowing or whatever I'm not going to like that.
395.99	0.15	I could get a...
398.27	0.95	I could get a car.
399.7	4.63	I probably shouldn't because I'm scared of driving in the city.
405.58	0.63	I'm sure...
406.77	2.25	oh but if Allie has to...
409.97	9.32	if Allie has to move back in with my mom or with Uncle Mike then my mom will actually probably give me Allie's car because she doesn't need the car if she's living with them.
419.77	1.94	She'll need it right now because she's living not with them.
423.17	2.07	But then I don't know if I want the car.
425.32	1.2	Maybe Tim can drive it around.
427.11	1.4	I 12 minutes...
429.09	1.94	I could walk 12 minutes or I can take the bus.
431.07	1.14	It's honestly not that big of a deal.
432.25	2.76	I don't know why I'm making a big deal out of it.
435.95	2.63	Oh I could just live closer to campus.
439.25	1.92	I'm still talking about housing and stuff.
441.98	0.65	No there was those...
442.86	2.77	oh and then so places closer are always more expensive though.
446.06	3.13	Remington Row is also like decently expensive.
449.32	0.71	I don't have money.
450.4	0.4	What do I do?
451.39	0.58	I'll figure it out.
452.04	1.42	I could get a house with friends.
454.65	1.37	I just need to find more people.
456.2	6.53	I'm sure Daniel doesn't have anyone but I don't think my parents would be fine with me living with other guys.
462.76	2.46	Probably only other girls so I shouldn't really think about him.
465.46	0.68	He'll figure it out.
466.63	1.14	Him and his roommates will figure it out.
467.79	0.94	They always figure stuff out.
468.75	0.69	I don't even know how.
470.7	2.01	Speaking of I saw his roommate...
472.87	0.49	what's his name?
473.49	0.36	Brian.
474.57	0.25	Brian?
474.9	2.6	Oh no all three of his roommates are my cog psych class.
477.91	0.96	I didn't even say hi.
478.92	1.11	I kind of feel bad about that.
480.19	0.63	I saw them.
481.78	4.04	We didn't make eye contact though so actually maybe they didn't see me but I didn't say hi to them.
485.96	0.76	It's so sad.
488.07	4.76	I could walk with them to class honestly but do I really care?
493.64	0.63	I could just go.
494.3	1.93	I walked with Daniel anyway so it really doesn't matter.
498.16	3.35	Okay oh and then the cog psych I need to get.
501.99	0.91	I need to get the textbook.
502.95	0.7	I need to get the textbook.
503.72	1.03	There's so many classes.
505.56	2.25	Will I even use the textbook if I get it?
508.78	0.92	Because there's like...
510.4	0.41	Orgo?
510.88	0.38	Orgo?
511.3	5.71	Okay I have to get the textbook for that because apparently class today was something else.
517.37	2.15	I don't think I can learn from what he teaches.
520.13	0.92	Becky was probably right.
521.07	4.54	She said she learned it mostly on her own and from her pilot leader.
526.57	3.63	So I'm probably gonna have to learn on my own which sucks because I don't learn on my own.
530.67	1.21	I don't learn on my own.
532.26	3.85	Normally I have to like talk to it or I have to be taught it.
536.87	1.09	I'm not really self-taught.
537.99	0.94	I'll figure it out.
539.48	3.44	I just need to make sure I get all of my stuff in order.
543.36	1.6	Probably need to take notes the same way.
545.0	1.24	I'm so worried about the test.
547.07	6.11	I shouldn't be worried about the test though because those are literally at the end of the semester so I'm gonna try to stay stress-free somehow.
553.98	3.73	Oh it's only the beginning of the semester and I have so much work.
558.26	1.27	That really sucks.
560.59	2.53	I feel like I'm stressing myself out the more I think about this.
563.15	1.36	I probably shouldn't be thinking about it.
566.2	1.15	I can't stop thinking about it now.
567.75	2.08	That's problematic but whatever.
572.97	0.93	Oh Red Cross.
573.93	2.1	I need to make an account for that.
576.11	2.01	I've needed to make an account for half a year.
578.69	1.86	It's been more than half a year and I still haven't.
581.63	4.52	Should probably make note to make that account and then I also need to make...
586.88	0.82	no not make the...
588.18	0.82	not make anything else.
589.05	10.46	I need to log my hours on so I'm probably gonna have to go through my calendar and figure out how many hours I've actually done with them because I didn't have my account to keep track of it which really sucks.
599.57	2.87	I guess that's probably why people make the accounts earlier.
