6.34	3.56	Uh so this is loud um but not too too bad.
10.59	6.75	I am wishing that um or I’m thinking that it’s not as tight as I thought it would be.
17.79	2.12	I guess I kind of like enclosed spaces.
20.39	2.97	Um I even wish it was more tightly compact.
23.48	2.96	I think that I wouldn’t be so nervous about moving.
26.99	12.26	Um this I’m thinking a lot about how um this is reminding me of meditation where someone tells you ok get comfortable and then you’re going to be in this seat for a very long time and you’re not supposed to move.
39.94	4.89	So I’m thinking a lot about how maybe I should’ve sat differently, maybe not.
47.95	2.29	Grateful for the cross to stare at.
52.17	2.64	I feel like it’s going to be interesting watching a movie.
55.22	5.04	Um im normally a very animated talker so I’m going to try not, obviously, to move.
61.04	1.92	Um and stay very still.
63.81	5.55	Um my nose is a little itchy but um I think it’s probably in my head.
71.89	3.33	I’m curious of what I’ve got going on today.
75.71	1.8	Um I have a meeting.
77.55	1.87	I have to leave at noon.
81.08	5.27	I didn’t look up who which Uber executive it’s with so that’s probably not good.
86.72	9.42	I feel like it’s always useful to look up who you’re talking to to have a better um understanding of who like what the context of the conversation is going to be.
96.62	4.49	Yesterdays with um Andrew I think that’s his name was interesting.
101.69	2.76	Um I didn’t realize he’s from Canada.
104.98	2.68	He didn’t have a really strong Canadian accent.
108.13	7.07	Um but it was interesting to note that he didn’t necessarily have that much experience before going into being the exec.
115.67	1.0	He went to college.
117.29	2.14	Um didn’t actually even go to grad school.
119.99	3.63	And then, tried and kind of failed at a startup idea.
123.62	2.03	At while I guess after consulting.
128.44	5.4	And then was just I guess hired by uber and rose through the ranks.
133.84	1.58	So that’s kind of interesting.
136.02	3.21	When as I’m thinking about career paths of late um.
139.78	4.98	I wonder what it would be like to um kind of change paths like that.
144.77	5.47	From thinking you’re going to be an entrepreneur to uh eventually just picking.
151.19	4.09	I guess Uber’s not really like corporate America.
155.3	1.82	It’s still kind of techy and startupy like.
157.28	1.48	But it’s still.
159.15	2.18	Um so I wonder what this next guy.
161.52	1.34	I think it’s a man.
163.09	3.03	What this next guy is gonna talk about and what his story’s going to be.
167.17	2.65	I think a lot about like what I say.
169.93	4.39	It makes me think about like how I answer questions when I’m in an informational interviews.
174.82	9.65	I’ve had a couple lately with prospective Hamilton or Tuck students as well as um people interested in getting into consulting.
185.0	7.85	And I feel like I say the same answers a bunch of times around you know like I really like I’m really people mission driven.
193.38	12.17	Um I find myself being led by or be making decision based off of how I feel like at the company or at the location.
206.1	9.71	Um I feel like those are useful things to share but at the same time I always feel like I’m wondering like how I can be most helpful to whoever im speaking with.
215.85	3.96	But maybe that’s maybe that’s not necessarily the right way to approach this.
219.86	3.65	I feel like they don’t always know what they want.
223.69	0.84	And so.
225.86	2.41	I shouldn’t try to cater to what I think they want.
228.29	8.13	I should just answer their questions and um they can draw whatever conclusions they want from it.
237.3	6.98	Um I’m excited uh about my upcoming I guess marathon.
245.34	0.61	A little nervous.
246.0	2.12	I feel like today’s run went okay.
248.68	2.31	Um I wasn’t necessarily supposed to be pushing it.
254.57	4.05	I feel like every time I run I’m nervous that I’m going to get injured.
261.19	5.92	And I guess I need to really tackle that like long run um.
267.34	3.73	I think I just have to do 10 this Friday.
271.3	5.87	But then I have um 15 I think next Saturday which is wild.
277.67	1.84	I feel like that’s a huge jump.
281.73	2.57	The tradeoff I feel like you know is to like run slower.
284.39	6.13	But like if you run slower, then it takes longer cause it’s not timed it’s by mileage.
291.38	4.95	I don’t know how people uh like manage staying hydrated.
296.34	5.15	I feel like one of the biggest issues that I have is I get thirsty and then running becomes hard.
302.47	4.0	Um I feel like in race day of course they have water stations which is nice but.
307.89	1.58	When you’re training, it’s like I don’t.
309.49	7.63	I need to get that belt thing that you put around your waist where you pack it with different water bottles, snacks.
317.19	5.03	I really like the goo um in those goo packs.
322.22	5.79	And I guess also the shock blocks are pretty tasty um.
328.77	0.86	I feel like in CRU those were always really fun.
331.08	4.91	It was the only thing I liked about when we had to row the 6ks and such.
336.06	4.03	It was like you could bring snacks and stuff uh.
340.69	3.92	It’s kinda wild for me to think about how much I uh I used to row.
344.61	6.98	Like the erg machines are the worst now and I feel like when I go to the gym I can only do 1 minute on them.
351.6	2.35	But I used to sit on them for hours.
355.07	1.48	I don't know if I could do that again.
356.64	1.45	But it would be kind of fun.
358.75	8.14	I feel like in uh boston this fall maybe I should try to see if I can join some kind of boat house to try it out.
367.48	18.22	I wonder, though, I feel like part of the reason it didn’t CRU didn’t really work for me in college is because I like couldn’t really handle going from like the competitiveness of community rowing to hamilton’s program.
386.65	15.61	So I wonder if that would be the same issue in the fall cause I feel like I don't have the the time to like join a masters program where like you get up at 4am and go to the boat house and then do all that stuff.
402.36	2.76	So I feel like I would have to join more of like a rec league.
405.83	1.88	If like CRU even has that.
408.45	3.19	But maybe I wouldn’t like that for the reason I just said so hm.
412.88	1.29	I have to figure that out.
414.21	1.7	Also it’s kind of expensive.
416.77	4.75	I feel like it’ll be interesting being in a city and trying to be frugal.
421.52	8.96	I feel like in Hanover it wasn’t too too hard because there wasn’t a lot to spend your money on.
431.49	9.29	But now, I feel like there’ll be good food and like I guess some free stuff like museums may be free?
440.78	1.0	I need to look into it.
441.8	8.39	I feel like I got spoiled by DC where you could go to all the Smithsonians for free.
450.87	1.18	That was really nice.
452.77	1.32	I don't think I did that enough.
455.02	2.64	I’m glad I made it to the African American museum.
457.66	2.51	That one was super good.
460.63	1.23	But it was weird.
461.9	5.99	I remember I like wasn’t feeling perfectly well I remember getting sick so.
469.57	3.65	I wonder if I went back uh if I would get more out of it.
473.7	11.08	Uh It was so interesting that they made their like housing design that building and had you cramped like start onto the first floor and go up.
485.44	2.21	And how like they.
488.1	2.08	I don't know if this is a myth or not but I heard.
490.21	13.59	It’s so interesting that they like supposedly wanted you to feel claustrophobic down on the first level to help I guess replicate what it would be like to be on a slave ship.
505.16	4.87	Now that I say it out loud maybe maybe that was just something someone said.
510.06	1.7	Who knows if that’s true.
512.44	1.64	I hope that more people can go.
514.08	5.14	It was so hard to get tickets that first time so.
519.76	2.13	I hope more people can go cause it’s pretty good.
522.37	3.87	I wonder what the next Smithsonian that they’re going to make is.
527.0	4.73	Um maybe itll be something around like Asian pacific islanders.
531.73	12.98	I feel like sometimes they respond to like political events or like um what is it what is it called like like social causes.
544.8	1.88	So I feel like maybe they would make one like that.
547.33	7.88	I wonder though cause like the Asian group is so large and diverse so I wonder what histories they would choose to share and tell.
555.89	2.56	Um now Im thinking about dia.
559.06	1.73	I wonder how she’s doing.
561.28	2.17	Um I hope that this summer she gets a little bit of a break.
564.25	1.8	I feel like the.
566.78	9.7	Last year was a doozy for her with all the DE and I conversations that she had to facilitate and then issues she had to resolve.
576.93	9.41	Now im curious about whatever happened with Kathleen and the reconciliation process she went through with the um.
587.79	6.08	I guess like I don't know why Im surprised but that was such a big deal in the moment and then it all kind of just faded away.
595.04	6.38	I guess that’s just a testament to how that always happens.
