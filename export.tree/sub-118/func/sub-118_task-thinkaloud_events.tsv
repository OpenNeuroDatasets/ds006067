2.64	4.78	I need to go do GBC after this.
9.02	2.75	I hope my polymers will be okay.
12.2	1.34	The polymers should be drying.
14.35	2.15	Some of them are sitting in a vacuum oven.
17.54	2.8	After that, I need to go do some work.
20.89	1.41	Go write some essays.
23.65	5.76	I need to do the sociology essay that I need to do. It's due next week.
29.68	7.2	Also, I need to do my culture essay, due on Tuesday.
37.84	2.46	Otherwise, I just need to catch up with some lectures.
41.02	1.86	I should go get some dinner after that.
44.92	1.04	Dinner should be nice.
46.42	3.62	I want to go at this pho place that I haven't been to for a really, really long time.
52.26	2.68	I hope the pho is pretty good today.
55.4	1.95	After that, I'm going to call my parents.
58.12	2.46	I hope my family is doing well.
62.0	4.37	Then tomorrow, I have a meeting at 11:00.
66.59	2.41	I need to go through that. I need to do that.
69.36	4.36	I hope the kids at Pilot will be doing okay for the upcoming midterm.
74.76	2.45	I probably need to run a review session for them.
78.83	2.1	Dawson is just not a really good professor.
80.97	1.59	I really hope he gets his stuff together.
83.0	5.46	Then after that, I have a board meeting.
89.04	4.04	We need to organize our event for Monday and Tuesday.
94.07	2.67	I hope Nick is taking care of the event on Monday.
97.38	2.28	And then I hope the merch sale on Tuesday, people will come.
100.42	5.06	I hope they didn't blow a lot of money over spring break, so that they'll be able to spend it on our stuff.
106.66	4.38	Speaking of the department, I hope the department will be finding a new head soon.
111.4	1.28	I really wonder who it is.
113.85	3.83	It has to be a tenured faculty, so it can't be any junior faculties.
119.54	1.71	Maybe [Al Sumaya] again.
121.92	6.27	And then speaking of the department, I need to go get Dr. Josephine for class meeting stuff…
130.08	4.6	…which is something I need to ask the board tomorrow during the meeting.
136.46	2.79	Also on that, I need to get my presentation together for that.
140.1	3.78	And speaking of presentation, I also need to do my poster for DREAMS.
144.82	2.06	Do registration for that.
149.1	1.08	So, that'll be fun.
150.85	6.5	Then I may also need to double-check on these guys for the Phoenix conference, see if they're doing okay.
158.11	2.13	So, it's going to be a pretty busy week.
161.0	4.06	Other than that, I think I just need to respond to a couple of emails.
166.36	1.86	Eric, I hope Eric is doing okay.
168.49	0.6	He should be chilling.
169.34	2.34	He already got into dental school.
173.38	1.97	So, I hope everything is all right with him.
175.84	4.0	I haven't gotten dinner with him for a long time, so maybe we should do that in the future.
183.56	2.79	I wonder how Cammie is going.
186.72	2.5	Maybe I should hang out with her sometime soon.
189.58	1.26	I haven't seen her for a hot minute.
192.34	5.34	Otherwise, I think I've been seeing a lot of my friends this break, which has been pretty good.
199.62	4.8	Then yes, otherwise, sometime, I want to go skiing next year for spring break.
206.18	1.51	Maybe somewhere up in Pittsburgh.
208.45	2.21	I haven't seen some of my Pittsburgh friends for a little bit.
211.26	4.58	So, maybe I should go up there next time during the break.
217.0	4.15	Then maybe sometime, to New York.
221.25	1.36	I wonder how well Daniel is doing.
223.23	5.67	His work at Credit Suisse must not be very easy these days, with the bank.
230.32	1.59	I should go to New York sometime.
232.27	6.73	The bus tickets are crazily pricey right now. I think, maybe, I could go right after school ends.
239.26	1.26	That would be nice.
241.33	3.0	Maybe see Kai and a couple of friends out there in New York City.
245.32	3.6	I probably need to see if John Lee will let me stay over at his place.
250.28	5.3	Yes. Speaking of John Lee, I hope he's doing well at Brown.
257.48	1.55	He is what?
259.06	1.6	A third year student now?
261.48	1.45	I don't know if he's still...
263.38	1.77	I think he took the MCAT already.
265.26	1.66	I really wonder how he did.
268.44	1.68	If he's applying this cycle or now.
272.28	1.6	And maybe if I have the time…
273.89	2.55	…I should go back and see Loomis.
277.33	3.75	Loomis is where I went to for high school.
282.44	2.94	Hopefully, I'll be able to see some of my old professors there…
286.08	1.14	…and see how they're doing.
288.04	4.68	I know Eric Joyce recently left, so maybe I should catch up with her.
292.83	1.29	I wonder where she went.
297.4	1.08	Yes, that would be fun.
299.24	3.78	Caesar is doing the commencement speech for Loomis, which is interesting.
304.2	7.18	It's more interesting that Hopkins hasn't announced their commencement speaker yet, even though the graduation is coming up very, very soon.
312.0	1.77	I really wonder who it's going to be.
314.2	4.44	I'm hoping it's someone good. They should really announce that soon.
320.88	4.5	I wonder if there will be a graduation sometime around then, so I'll probably go to that.
327.32	6.99	JHU graduation is on May 25th, I think, so that would be nice.
334.97	2.56	And then after that, I need to find a job.
338.24	2.58	I probably need to go talk to my PI one day…
341.62	2.62	…and see if he's willing to pay me for research.
345.13	1.06	He should be able to.
347.08	2.1	I just haven't had the chance to talk to him recently.
350.12	2.01	I hope his daughter is doing well.
352.34	2.72	He's been out of town for a little bit because of that. So, yes.
358.24	5.96	PhD student visit is this weekend, so maybe I'll see some incoming PhD students.
364.22	1.11	I'll be able to talk to them.
366.26	3.24	I think there was Lauren from Georgia Tech.
369.71	1.81	There's someone else from Michigan.
372.0	3.9	They should be interesting people to talk to for that.
376.79	5.09	I wonder how they're feeling about our lab.
381.9	0.98	It's a small lab.
383.09	6.51	I know a lot of progress is being made, but hopefully, we'll make some stuff soon.
392.0	2.45	What else? Yes, then I just need to go back and do my polymers.
397.38	4.12	Yes, I think we really do need to decide on a direction for the research project.
403.04	5.06	Also, I need to just keep on monitoring our progress.
409.06	3.3	I hope Sarah is going to be able to design the software experiment…
412.5	4.22	…and then I'll just keep on working on the polymers, making the formulations.
420.0	6.78	Yes. Polymer, I don't know why that one is super in gel form.
427.34	3.48	I hope it's going to be all right, even though it sounds like it's going to be all right.
434.3	2.23	Then I'll probably go for NMR sometime.
437.64	2.82	I need to do the NMR training, actually.
441.54	6.22	Go for NMR, do the NMR training, maybe get some coffee after that too.
450.56	3.25	And then I need to email a couple of people about the NMR training.
454.92	1.68	And so, that'll be always fun.
460.0	3.24	I think, oh yes, I need to email Jessica to get on the flow chart.
465.48	2.24	There's a lot of things to do.
478.09	4.95	Oh yes, I also probably need to clear my stuff out of my fridge.
486.7	3.12	Yes, I have some old stuff in my fridge.
490.7	1.59	Oh yes, the SEM images.
493.1	2.54	I need to talk to them, see if they can get the stubs…
496.12	1.5	…of the SEM images.
500.89	2.6	I also need to get rid of the salt in my solution.
506.0	5.36	I wonder if we can make a nanoparticle somewhere else other than that.
512.24	3.32	Possibly, maybe with just pure water instead of PPS.
515.64	4.7	That might help a little bit. Yes.
521.27	1.61	I don't know.
523.22	4.22	I think, yes, after that, I'm probably going to go catch up on some TV shows.
529.04	3.97	CBS TV shows should be up this coming week…
533.27	2.69	…so I should have some time to catch up.
536.86	2.98	I think March Madness tournament is going on right now.
540.52	4.52	I know my friends are really interested in that, so maybe I'll watch some of that with them.
546.02	2.76	I wonder what the championship is.
549.38	2.07	This year, Alabama got knocked out.
551.79	3.17	So, maybe this year's tournament is all up for grabs.
556.54	2.8	I know F1 is next weekend, I think.
561.99	2.84	Yes, F1 is next weekend in Australia.
565.53	2.33	It starts from 1 am in the morning for us.
568.12	3.98	Okay, so that'll be by 1 am, Sunday morning.
572.97	1.02	That should be an easy watch.
574.92	1.16	And so, yes, I'm excited.
576.68	3.66	Then next weekend is tour weekend…
580.41	1.02	…so a lot of tours.
583.29	5.99	I need to send some emails out for Blue Key to get all my tour guides together.
591.04	3.77	Then touring will be off for a couple of weekends.
595.6	3.2	And then there's the Mid-Atlantic conference.
