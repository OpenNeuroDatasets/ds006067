12.7	1.14	I’m pretty hungry right now.
14.26	6.29	Um, I- I do have mini tacos that I can eat for lunch, um, and yeah.
20.56	4.54	That reminds me, tacos they remind me of like Spanish like you know Mexican food oh uh.
25.32	5.01	That reminds me of my um the one restaurant in uh in New Jersey where I would go in with my friends.
30.34	2.62	I miss my friends, they’re – they’re fun.
33.01	0.78	They’re from high school.
33.8	3.53	I guess it was a good time, just hanging with the guys all the time.
37.49	3.85	Yeah I remember my one friend Andrew he um we used to play games together.
41.42	3.29	Um we used to play league of legends even though I didn’t know anything about it.
44.97	2.45	Uh but now my other friends are teaching me that too at home.
47.44	1.41	I mean not home in Baltimore.
49.28	3.29	And in my new house um my friend Stanley plays it a lot.
52.61	4.21	Uh he has he told me to clean the kitchen earlier today.
57.03	2.67	Uh I did though, cos I’m a responsible person of course.
60.38	4.03	Uh hopefully I’m responsible, I – I don’t… hopefully they think that of me.
64.42	4.43	I don’t want to be – not a bad impression I don’t want them to have a bad impression of me.
68.86	2.87	Anyway uh this scanner is kinda loud.
71.75	0.63	That’s okay.
72.84	4.69	Um cos uh that is kind of loud, reminds me of the other scan I had.
77.91	5.75	Um I was just sitting there in the scanner for uh many many many many minutes.
83.69	0.99	I was just sitting there.
85.25	5.15	I had to go to the bathroom that entire time which was kind of sad because it made it less enjoyable.
90.7	2.15	The other scanner I was in, it kind of broke.
92.86	3.28	The coils were new that day, they were just delivered and I felt really bad for the guy.
96.59	1.21	He seemed like a really nice guy.
97.88	3.52	He was kind of bald though um but that’s okay, it’s not – it’s not a bad thing.
101.91	4.5	But it reminds me of my bald priest from church and uh.
106.53	4.47	That reminds me of the church at home and hey yeah, that was.
111.14	4.5	Tt’s pretty nice I I went there all my life um ever since I was a kid.
116.29	3.06	My childhood was pretty fun, I went to the carnival a lot there.
119.7	3.88	The carnival was a really fun time I used to see my friends there.
124.17	4.31	Uh it’d always be really hot though so I’d get a little sweaty, which is kind of embarrassing hahaha.
128.58	0.86	That’s pretty funny.
129.82	3.43	Um but yeah I had I played the games at the carnival.
133.29	5.73	Uh I played basketball uh um pretty split – I used to play basketball in um Six Flags.
139.54	2.47	Uh that’s where they had the games even though they were ripoffs.
142.02	1.58	I remember I watched a YouTube video about it.
143.89	9.93	They’re kinda scams since like the since like it costs – the actual prizes cost more for you to pay uh I I it’s weird to think about it just there’s some like weird explanation to it.
153.9	5.33	Yeah I saw that YouTube by some one like scam guy and then yeah.
159.31	2.21	I’ve been watching YouTube a lot uh.
161.56	2.14	Oh I I’ve also been watching a lot of Marvel movies.
163.71	2.5	I was watching endgame earlier I can go on and on about that.
166.67	3.17	Yeah endgame was pretty cool um.
170.68	9.14	Something I enjoy – something I wanna do more with my friends more often especially this one girl um well she is was my girlfriend that’s a complicated situation.
180.18	2.68	I mean I could talk about that a little bit yeah.
182.88	4.85	It’s just I don’t know how I’ve been feeling, it’s been just kinda sad sometimes um.
188.04	6.59	Very indecisive with my life, so like I don’t always make decisions like well or make decisions like right away.
195.09	7.99	I’ve been very indecisive and I don’t know like how I don’t know what I’ve been doing sometimes and that’s a bit sad.
203.13	5.89	Um yeah so anyway looking at I’m looking at this little cross.
209.09	1.24	It’s all white and grey.
211.23	2.49	It reminds me of this one grey shirt I had at home I was supposed to wear it today.
213.74	8.71	I didn’t know what to wear today um I am wearing a gray shirt but this one has caramel on it like my other shoes, but those shoes have a little orange on it.
223.21	4.49	Yeah oh it kinda reminds me of the color salmon but it’s a little different.
227.78	6.21	But I wish I’d thawed my salmon earlier today because yeah I could’ve eaten it for lunch instead of my mini tacos.
234.68	3.86	But uh I should’ve put my salmon into the air fryer, that would’ve been nice.
238.55	1.4	Air fryers are really good, good purchase.
239.96	1.3	It reminds me of my old apartment.
241.28	3.56	That was the only thing that kept me at my old apartment like that helped me survive.
245.3	4.89	Oh I see the PowerPoint logo on the laptop screen that’s pretty good.
250.2	5.96	I used to use Google Slides all the time I use PowerPoint more often since I got to on it this new computer.
256.53	8.46	And I got this one computer cos actually my internship got canceled last summer uh after freshmen year and I worked at a food place instead to get money.
265.0	14.53	And yeah it helped me get my little computer for ... that’s my other and I got I was able to like um online research for my other lab through it, I was able to use like a few certain programs, like I was using Chemdraw to like draw a bunch of chemical structures and a while yeah.
280.04	2.44	I haven’t thought about chemistry in a while.
282.49	1.83	Applied chemistry was a great class.
284.88	3.45	It was very difficult, I solved global warming on the exam kind of.
289.28	1.59	It was about like a football stadium.
291.35	6.89	There was a football stadium question and but it was about soccer though not football but they call it different things here and yeah/
298.25	8.78	The soc- soccer’s pretty cool I mean it’s it’s boring to watch sometimes but it gets people pretty excited like a bunch of the fans are all like screaming um.
307.05	3.09	There’s probably some country with like a white and green like logo.
310.41	3.52	Oh and Nigeria has a has a green flag I think or part of it’s green.
314.28	7.45	I’m not the best with flags I know there’s a white and greenish flag somewhere yeah Nigeria or another country I’m not sure.
321.85	1.36	It’s pretty bad um.
323.33	2.47	I should probably know my countries better yeah.
325.81	0.46	And then that’s.
326.81	14.57	Nigeria’s in Africa um it reminds me of like uh the globe, it’s just a map and then how it looks kind of flat um hm kinda round and then ooh there’s Mexico right down America ooh Alaska.
341.41	8.99	Alaska oh um I remember the person who actually got me into this study, her her username had like something to do – something to do with Alaska in the GroupMe.
350.54	1.45	I think her name was Cathy.
352.58	1.11	Yeah She’s Asian.
353.7	0.81	She seems really nice.
354.52	1.52	She seemed really into the study.
356.54	4.9	Um yeah that’s how – that was on Groupme and prof and that’s uh.
361.89	5.46	I remember her profile picture I thought um Elizabeth was um Cathy for a second like cos I didn’t know anyone.
367.84	4.34	Ooh sharing screen on PowerPoint I see, restart.
372.66	3.73	Oh I was using excel last night and I made a bunch of shortcuts.
376.44	4.23	They’re not really shortcuts just I was able to do my excel sheet faster than the other undergrad.
381.46	6.3	The other undergrad he’s nice I mean he’s a little newer to the lab so uh it takes him a little longer to do a few things.
389.11	9.65	He came into the lab last night at like 11 o’clock to like finish a procedure since he he was supposed to start it like earlier um but it kinda got messed up and stuff.
398.83	1.8	It was a paintbrush and a sharing thing.
401.15	1.53	Um painting.

422.96	2.75	Um that’s why I don’t like playboy like that the brand.
426.18	1.97	Um it’s like buying buying shirt and clothes.
428.17	1.68	But my friend Emily has a playboy shirt.
430.23	2.6	So it was I was like oh that’s kinda confusing.
