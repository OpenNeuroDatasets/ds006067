2.87	7.6	Alright, um, I am thinking about what I'm going to do after the scan.
10.93	3.1	I'm starting to think I should have had breakfast before I came.
15.43	3.54	I have some bagels at home, sitting on my kitchen counter.
20.13	3.52	They like taste really weird, like they were made with tap water or something.
24.43	0.84	But they're blueberry.
26.57	3.58	I'm thinking I'd like to have those for breakfast after I leave.
31.13	2.3	I made some pineapple jam last Sunday.
35.07	5.02	I like cut up the fresh pineapples and cooked it down on my stove.
40.35	1.28	I cooked it with cloves.
42.37	2.42	The next time I make it I need to add more cloves.
44.81	1.68	The flavor isn't strong enough.
47.45	1.52	But I think it turned out really well.
50.09	1.5	I put that on the bagel.
52.37	4.72	I don't know how well blueberry bagel and pineapple goes, but it will probably be good.
57.99	1.84	It's too bad I ran out of cream cheese.
61.39	2.56	It was such a nice day when I was walking here this morning.
64.65	2.6	I hope the weather stays this nice.
67.99	4.12	I was in Houston, Texas Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
73.09	1.66	It just rained the whole time.
75.53	2.2	It rained really, really heavy on Tuesday.
78.03	1.2	The streets flooded.
80.09	2.14	I was there for a...
82.79	1.48	I was visiting Baylor.
85.13	5.14	During the downpour I was doing a driving tour of the city with a resident.
90.85	2.76	We got caught in flooded streets.
93.67	1.42	It was actually really awful.
96.61	1.52	It was like a little bit weird.
99.13	3.82	He wouldn't stop talking about his finances and this house that he had just bought.
104.31	2.7	He like took me on the tour to see it.
107.33	3.5	It was like a nice house, but like very strange.
111.49	1.78	The whole visit was very strange.
114.47	5.88	The Airbnb where I stayed, the host had two dogs, Muffin and Stella I think.
121.41	2.52	Oh my god, those dogs were so rambunctious.
124.73	3.52	As soon as I walked in the door, I was having like...
128.43	1.44	I had like dinner in my hands.
130.87	1.66	They like knocked me down and stole it.
134.37	1.12	They're sweet dogs though.
136.05	1.28	They just wanted to say hi.
137.53	1.62	They weren't malicious or anything.
140.13	3.72	But oh dear god, I'm so glad my pet doesn't like that.
145.25	2.92	My cat Zara, she's so tiny and so sweet.
149.95	1.8	Much lower energy than them.
152.03	4.72	Oh my god, I don't know how my host could deal with that day in and day out.
158.17	2.42	I'm glad I have a low maintenance pet.
162.01	1.92	She slept with me last night.
164.59	2.16	I think she missed me while I was gone.
167.97	2.18	Either that or she was just cold.
171.25	2.74	She was really excited to see me when I got home yesterday.
175.09	2.44	She was purring, rubbing up against my legs.
178.65	2.76	When I went to shower, she wouldn't leave me alone.
181.53	3.76	She sat in my bathroom and stared at me the whole time.
186.47	2.08	She used to do that a lot when she was a kitten.
189.19	3.54	But she hasn't done it that intensely for a very long time.
194.87	3.54	I don't think she's going to be very happy with me for the next month.
199.03	1.94	I have a lot more trips coming up.
201.75	2.16	New York next week.
205.03	2.58	I guess nothing the week after.
207.63	2.52	Then North Carolina, then back to New York.
213.23	2.3	I say I like traveling, but it's so exhausting.
216.51	3.56	I'll be glad when all this is over and March 17th comes.
223.85	1.4	I'm excited to see Fang tonight.
226.15	1.66	I wonder what we're going to get for dinner.
229.19	2.2	I was thinking yesterday that I wanted to get pizza.
234.29	0.72	There was this chain pizza I had.
236.29	1.46	I don't even remember where I was.
239.67	1.1	Maybe it was when I was...
241.49	4.56	Oh, it was when I was connecting in DC when I was coming home from New York after my subway last summer.
247.21	4.02	But I just found out that this chain is in Baltimore and I would love to get the same pizza again.
252.89	1.42	White sauce and pesto.
254.49	0.94	Oh, it was so good.
256.49	1.74	I think there were mushrooms on it too.
259.95	1.8	There are so many different types of mushrooms.
264.07	3.22	The mushrooms in the dumplings that Z made last weekend were so good.
269.19	2.04	I'm sad I ate all the leftovers already.
272.07	1.4	I would have liked to have more.
274.77	2.58	But I think the dumpling dough could have been better.
277.37	2.2	It was a little bit chewy and a little bit too thick.
281.25	1.62	I'd like to try making dumplings.
284.43	1.8	I think I need to buy the wrapper though.
286.95	1.78	Making the dough seemed really intensive.
291.25	2.88	I should text Pra and ask her for her bomo recipe.
295.81	1.24	Those were always really good.
298.95	1.4	I'm kind of sorry she moved out.
302.75	1.34	I like my new roommates though.
305.53	1.64	Nita is super intense though.
309.13	3.1	She kind of makes me wish that I worked harder.
314.49	2.16	Nah, she likes doing research though.
318.27	2.3	I need to submit that paper today.
322.31	0.57	It'll be okay.
323.08	0.87	It won't be too bad.
324.61	1.58	I've already prepped the file.
326.93	2.04	I just need to put it into the system.
331.91	3.2	I hope that book comes in from the library soon.
336.37	1.36	I hope it's not garbage.
338.76	0.41	It kind of sounds like garbage.
340.53	1.78	But I wanted to read it together with Fang.
343.25	0.94	And then discuss it.
345.59	1.96	I probably should have read Gone Girl with him.
347.93	1.4	That probably would have been better.
351.37	4.16	"I don't really want to finish the book I'm reading now, ""consider the lobster."""
356.57	1.14	I hate essays.
357.82	1.99	I don't know why I bought a book of essays.
361.55	1.0	That wasn't great.
364.55	1.82	I should read more out of my textbook.
369.29	0.36	I wish I had a subscription to The Atlantic.
370.37	2.12	That article I was reading earlier this morning was really interesting.
374.25	1.06	I wish I could have finished it.
375.79	1.3	I wonder how Fang gets The Atlantic.
379.23	5.26	It seems like he's always reading their articles, but I know he doesn't have a subscription.
384.51	0.94	I didn't make my bed this morning.
388.87	1.62	I need to make my bed.
394.33	2.22	I'm glad I remembered to turn on the electric blanket before I left though.
399.05	0.64	I bet when I get home, Zara's going to be curled up underneath all the covers.
402.35	0.24	She gets so cold at night.
404.45	1.04	It's because she's so little.
407.41	1.08	She doesn't have any fat on her.
410.73	0.66	But she eats so much.
413.69	0.9	I probably shouldn't have left my puzzle out.
417.05	0.72	She's probably going to get into it and get all the pieces all over the floor.
424.03	1.2	I hope she doesn't do that.
426.55	2.14	Good god, it's taken me so long to finish.
428.69	3.86	I'm glad it's almost the weekend.
435.25	3.28	Brunch on Sunday with Ashley and Albert is going to be a lot of fun.
441.49	1.28	I haven't seen him since...
445.75	0.08	two months?
447.03	3.84	I'm sorry Ashley cancelled drinks last night, but this weekend will be fun.
452.53	1.32	I've never done brunch at Barfuscina.
457.17	0.24	I hope they do breakfast tacos.
458.53	3.7	I wish I had tortillas at home.
464.73	0.22	And salsa.
467.53	1.1	Okay, if none of the ingredients were breakfast taco, I can't make that when I get home.
470.53	1.14	But brunch will be fun.
474.03	1.66	I wonder when February starts.
477.19	3.04	I wonder if I'll be able to finish dry January before Sunday.
485.07	1.4	And it doesn't really matter.
486.49	0.72	Well, we're doing something Saturday too.
488.53	2.9	Oh yeah, we're going to Peabody.
492.39	1.56	We're going to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
494.09	0.54	That'll be fun.
495.73	1.06	I've never been to Peabody.
496.82	1.23	I hope their beer is good.
498.69	1.02	I hope they have a sour.
501.61	1.0	I don't really like beers that aren't sour.
503.81	2.96	There's something else that's supposed to be going on then too.
507.23	1.2	I forgot.
510.07	1.86	I have a lot to do today.
513.95	1.82	I need to submit that manuscript.
519.51	0.8	I need to talk to Chase about housing next week.
521.81	2.44	Otherwise I'm going to be in New York and have nowhere to go.
525.81	2.0	Okay, I need to talk to Chase.
528.45	2.0	Absolutely, I need to stop putting that off.
531.53	0.98	I'll let you stay with him.
532.97	0.67	He always does.
533.69	0.8	He's such a good friend.
537.61	1.32	I'm so sorry that girl he was seeing didn't want to keep seeing him.
540.56	3.75	He's so nice, and he so wants a relationship, and he so deserves it.
544.34	0.79	He's such a sweetheart.
546.47	1.32	Even though he is a little bit weird.
548.53	1.88	But whatever.
553.03	0.28	Okay, I need to talk to him.
555.03	2.3	I know there's other things I need to do today.
558.15	1.06	What else is it?
560.71	1.6	No, not map.
563.63	0.86	I know I want to do that.
564.67	1.48	What else was on my to-do list?
567.61	2.16	Ugh, I need to coordinate the rest of my trips.
571.93	1.12	I don't have housing for...
573.95	3.28	Shit, I don't have housing for any of my upcoming trips.
578.61	2.0	I don't think I have transportation either.
582.29	1.7	I'm not very good at all this planning.
586.31	2.92	I know Fang and I were thinking about going on vacation to Brazil.
590.53	2.36	But if it's up to me to plan it, it's never going to happen.
593.89	2.08	I'm so bad at planning travel.
598.77	3.02	I need to reach out to Dr. Woodworth today too.
