3.38	5.24	I think it's really cool how you can see this mirror.
10.65	1.11	I love mirrors.
11.93	4.6	Mirrors are things where you can see your reflection.
18.24	16.44	I always love checking my reflection when I'm wearing a nice outfit and taking photos in fashion, clothes.
35.51	2.86	All of that stuff is just really cool.
39.8	2.01	It's a great way to express yourself.
44.71	6.53	When you take photos of things like sunsets and rainbows and things like that.
51.56	1.95	God, I haven't seen a rainbow in so long.
56.47	7.15	I never really saw rainbows when I was growing up because it never really rained where I was from, but now it's different.
63.66	11.45	I saw a rainbow in the summer once and it was really pretty because the sun only set at like 9pm that night, and there was a rainbow and a sunset happening at the same time.
75.16	2.36	And I don't think I was ever that happy.
80.68	3.74	That day we did a lot of fun things.
84.92	5.89	Took a lot of photos of the rainbows and the sunset, and it was really fun.
92.28	1.3	I miss the summer.
93.89	4.11	I think summer is probably the best season,
98.31	4.09	and I really, really can't wait for it to be warm again.
103.33	2.28	I didn't really like the fact that it's a little bit cold,
105.74	2.49	but today was not super cold.
108.64	1.52	It was cold, it was sunny,
110.18	3.83	and I really, really like it when it's sunny.
114.21	8.93	I was telling a friend that the sunshine, the sun is just the key to my happiness, the key to my serotonin.
126.43	1.19	I love being happy.
127.92	2.98	Puts me in a great mood for the rest of my day.
132.07	4.02	I think it's important for productivity for me.
137.09	7.84	When I'm trying to do my homework or when I'm trying to think good thoughts, if it's sunny outside, I'm automatically way more productive.
146.81	13.73	I was thinking about how seasonal depression is a real thing, because I'm way happier and way more productive when it's warm outside or it's sunny outside.
160.81	12.79	If it's sunny outside but it's still cold in winter, I can gaslight myself into thinking that it's still sunny, which is probably the best mind game that I play on myself.
176.53	2.96	I have a friend who loves playing mind games on people.
180.48	3.57	Maybe I should tell him that this is a cool mind game to play on himself.
186.34	12.04	I think mind games and stuff like that is a cool thing in psych that you can do research on, but I wonder how you would do that.
199.22	8.42	My friend who likes playing mind games also loves to talk about hypnosis, and I'm always very confused about whether that's a real thing or not.
209.25	1.98	Can you actually hypnotize yourself?
212.2	2.48	That's such a cool train of thought.
215.18	7.82	When I think of hypnotizing, I think of optical illusions and staring at one thing for so long that it becomes another thing.
224.2	2.75	I don't know, it's pretty cool in my opinion.
227.1	3.81	But I wonder what the science behind all of that actually is.
231.53	5.64	I wonder if there are people in the real world that actually only study optical illusions.
238.69	2.12	That would be such an interesting job, right?
242.25	9.88	During your day, just go up to a bunch of people, give them a lot of optical illusions and say, what do you think this is, what does this make you feel?
252.8	4.4	Conduct a whole research experiment on that and call it a day.
257.71	1.39	It'd be an interesting job.
259.78	3.16	I wonder what the most interesting jobs in the world are.
263.42	2.14	I was thinking about this the other day,
265.58	2.04	and I'm currently thinking about it.
267.66	6.45	And I remember reading somewhere that there is a job where you can become a chocolate taster.
274.5	6.81	Like your entire day you would just taste a bunch of different types of chocolate and you get paid for that.
281.99	3.4	You get paid to do so many different types of things, it's really cool.
286.06	7.65	Being a wine taster, being a tour guide, just having so much fun with your life but also getting paid for it.
294.34	1.81	Sign me up, please.
298.32	3.19	Speaking of tour guides, I want to do more traveling.
304.11	5.84	Go to lots of fun new places, explore many different continents and countries.
310.73	13.17	I was thinking about how much I wanted to travel to Greece, and I'm really looking forward to the summer and the time where I can actually travel again.
325.14	9.59	I was thinking about how the semester hasn't even started properly, but I'm already thinking about spring break and all the different places that I want to travel to.
335.57	2.86	I think traveling is so much fun, and I miss traveling.
340.09	1.93	It's been a long time since I've traveled,
343.87	2.47	and I can't wait to do it again.
347.21	5.08	Hopefully this spring or this summer, sometime like that.
353.08	3.49	Traveling alone could be such a therapeutic experience, I think.
359.22	11.93	When you do things alone, and you see new places alone, and you experience everything on your own, you can form all these opinions on your own and have no one else really tell you how to think or feel about it.
371.68	1.68	You just work on your own schedule.
373.39	7.29	Like if I went on holiday with my parents, which I've done very often, we always follow my mom's agenda or something.
381.28	3.53	It's never like my own sort of schedule.
385.85	15.26	I never get to lie in bed for longer than a few hours because my mom will be like, oh, yeah, let's go sightseeing right now at 8 in the morning.
401.14	3.66	If you don't wake up this instant, you won't get to eat breakfast.
405.68	1.66	So many tight schedules.
407.35	7.18	I think traveling on your own would really liberate you from having to work on someone else's agenda.
414.65	1.0	You should work on your own.
416.62	8.24	Working on your own agenda and working on your own schedule is something that more people need to know and more people need to do.
425.38	5.58	I think you got to be your own boss.
433.49	14.08	Was thinking about how we work for companies and go on everyone else's schedule, but everyone's day looks very different to each other regardless of whether they're doing the same job.
449.18	2.06	I think these differences are really cool.
451.61	5.19	The fact that these differences exist makes for fun stories that you can tell each other.
457.34	2.06	I love telling stories to people.
459.43	3.9	I love telling my friends the stories of my day.
463.97	2.64	Like when my friends will always ask me, how was your day?
466.69	2.64	Tell me what you did, and walk me through your day.
469.34	14.43	And it's always the best part of my day when she asks me that because I'm able to tell her exactly what I've done step by step, walk her through my day as if she's the one living it now and I'm reliving it through my narration.
484.24	10.52	And I love hearing her talk about her day too and walking me through her day, and I'm living her day through her, living vicariously through her.
496.81	6.84	Stories can be a great way to connect with people, connect with the world around us.
504.59	6.92	I remember reading storybooks as a child and honestly not loving them as much as I do now.
511.96	14.67	I wish I could go back to when I was younger to read those storybooks and do fun kid things like color the drawing book, or like paint by numbers or stuff like that.
527.27	5.78	Think a lot of stuff like that really reinvigorates the inner child.
535.02	10.26	I wonder how much of that is actually scientifically true, whether you have an inner child or not, whether it's important to connect with your inner child.
545.67	7.59	Been seeing this concept of having an inner child a lot on social media, like TikTok and stuff like that.
553.3	3.94	And I wonder how much of it is actually scientifically accurate.
560.3	9.7	I feel like on social media you see a lot of things that people think about their lives and no one really does their research beyond that.
570.34	4.29	And I feel like you do need to do it so that you know whether it's true or not.
577.49	10.06	I think TikTok and Instagram and stuff is a great way to connect with people, but at the same time, it's a great way to just sometimes spread false information.
587.69	1.5	Obviously, we don't want that.
590.91	14.92	Think people are very much responsible for their own thoughts and feelings, and are responsible for communicating that and understanding whether something is true or not.
