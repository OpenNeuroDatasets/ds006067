1.4	4.93	Okay, so I don't really know what to think about right now.
6.33	3.67	Umm, well, I should have worn my contacts today.
10.0	5.76	I really should have worn my contacts today because, uh the screen is kind of blurry but I can make out the words.
15.76	5.08	So I hope it doesn't uh, impact the study but it should be fine.
20.84	2.54	Anyway, I think this study's really cool.
23.38	6.9	I've never gotten an MRI before. Umm, and it's a lot less scary than I thought it would be honestly.
30.28	9.07	I've heard of people in the past talking about... Or at least they warn people about uh, that it could be claustrophobic or scary, but the mirror really helps.
39.35	6.8	And I can't really... It's like kind of hard to hear what I'm saying, but I, I can kind of make it out still.
49.01	5.66	Umm, so I had a fundraiser today. That was, that was my first fundraiser.
54.67	3.81	I was very nervous. I was kinda stressed about it in the beginning.
58.48	5.17	I even like... My dreams were stressed and I woke up not very well rested.
63.65	2.77	But, you know, it was good.
66.42	3.44	Umm, it turned out pretty well.
69.86	7.72	Some people didn't show up, but I was still able to stay extra because my class was canceled.
79.17	6.66	unfortunately because the teacher was sick but, you know, at least I could stay longer for the fundraiser.
85.83	6.67	Umm, people in the beginning didn't really uh, buy anything.
92.5	1.49	It was mostly people that we know.
93.99	5.08	And even after a while, it was still people that we know that we kind of forced them to buy something.
99.07	2.76	But, you know, it's okay.
101.83	9.62	Then we ended up uh, reducing the cost to half of what it was, so $2 to $1, and it was, you know, it was better.
111.45	3.59	I think more people walked by and then stopped to consider.
115.04	2.31	So I think that was pretty effective.
117.35	5.62	I mean, I personally... I mean, even if it was $1, I don't even know if I would do it.
122.97	3.0	So you know, kudos to the people who actually bought a cookie.
128.83	2.81	I should think about what I have to do today.
131.64	3.85	I still have to make my presentation for later today.
135.49	3.99	Uh, I don't know if I'll be able to do it honestly.
139.48	4.49	Umm, I won't have that much time, but it's an interesting topic.
143.97	5.85	Uh, so that'll be fun, and I can't wait to present it too, because it'll be funny.
149.82	4.13	Umm, Orgo, orgo is not fun.
153.95	5.8	I have a lot to do. I'm very, very behind and stressed about orgo.
159.75	7.44	Uh, it's... Yeah, it's... I'm constantly kind of lost in class, but I just need to read the textbook.
169.26	2.91	I really wanna do a study like this, you know.
172.17	3.17	Umm, hopefully I will in the future sometime.
175.34	7.3	But the research I'm doing right now is uh, in a wet lab, but honestly I'm not really doing anything.
182.64	3.31	Uh, they're not really letting me do anything in the research.
185.95	9.3	Like I'm just being trained so far in like DNA extraction, RT-PCR, stuff like that.
195.25	13.56	But I talked to the PI and her supervisor, and at least he knows who I am, so hopefully in the future he'll like let me do more stuff and actually get involved in the research more.
208.81	2.41	It's also a really cool lab.
211.22	7.94	Like they're very translational labs, so they work a lot with companies, biotechs to actually get their research out there.
219.16	3.22	So that's something I kinda wanna get into.
222.38	5.17	And that reminds me of umm, the... Trying to decide what minor I wanna do.
227.55	17.14	So I was very conflicted between choosing bioethics or business, or I mean I ended up kind of choosing entrepreneurship and management, uh, but I'm kinda nervous about how the classes will fit.
244.69	2.72	Uh, but hopefully it's fine.
247.41	5.99	I mean I'm kind of ahead of everyone by taking orgo, so ultimately it should be fine.
253.4	6.66	But my advisor, man, he really just... Uh, it's probably not good to talk about him like this but, you know, whatever.
260.06	7.62	He, uh, is not a very good advisor but it's kind of understandable since it's his first year.
267.68	4.18	I just kind of feel like he doesn't, he doesn't want to help me.
271.86	11.96	Umm, but it's also too much of a hassle to try to change advisors so uh, I think I'm just gonna try to figure things out myself or ask other advisors.
283.82	9.75	And anyway, next, next year I'll get like umm, an official major, so hopefully I get an, a, a major advisor there who can help me out.
293.57	6.53	And plus I have like mentors, uh, for the TriBeta Club.
300.1	3.77	Yeah I still haven't... I haven't gone to that in a while.
303.87	2.71	I should text my mentor just for fun I guess.
306.58	2.63	She's pretty cool, forgot her name.
309.21	2.05	I'll have to check on Instagram.
311.26	4.39	Sami, oh, Sami, I think. Umm, short for Samantha.
315.65	4.63	So anyway, I am staring back at the screen.
320.28	3.9	The cross is kind of blurry, but I can still tell it's a cross.
324.18	10.2	Umm, the study, I hope the results turn out good, uh, and I'm excited to get the MRI brain scan.
334.38	4.77	I wanna see if I can also make a 3D print of my brain.
339.15	5.48	But also, like I haven't... I was kind of scared of getting my brain scanned.
344.63	9.3	Uh, I think I used to be kind of a hypochondriac so I just didn't... I was like always worried that something was wrong with me.
353.93	8.21	And so I guess now we'll kind of find out if I have a normal brain or not, umm, if I can interpret it somehow.
362.14	4.94	FMRI, I think F stands for Functional MRI.
367.08	4.27	It's been a long time since I've learned it, umm, about that though.
371.35	2.58	My high school is weird.
373.93	8.3	My high school was a very uh... Was a vocational high school, even though they changed it a bunch of times.
382.23	3.08	Now they literally changed the name as soon as we left.
385.31	10.48	And now I hear that the current... From the current seniors that the... It, uh... That the freshmen literally get an associate's degree, umm, from going to the school.
395.79	7.03	Like we qualify for that because we take enough college credits in the high school, but we just didn't... We just got the credits.
402.82	2.99	We couldn't get a, a whole degree out of it.
405.81	3.72	Like that's, that's so cool. And that's such a flex.
409.53	3.0	Like I wish, I wish I got an associate's degree from it.
412.53	4.6	And... But I mean, I have friends who are even more upset about that.
417.13	7.35	So, uh, yeah, and then this is random, but I feel like I have a weird vocabulary.
424.48	4.71	Like when I was saying upset, I thought of the word miffed first.
429.19	7.26	And I don't know, people tell me that I have a pretty big vocabulary that kind of... That sounds weird sometimes.
436.45	6.89	I think that started when I, when I was little, I would just like to learn new words.
443.34	22.32	Umm, and honestly, okay, yeah... Uh, so when I would read something umm, and found out a new word like phantasmagorical, I would just really like the sound of it and then try to learn what it means and then try to incorporate it into what... Uh, into like, like saying it in real life.
465.66	4.26	And then of course, people don't really know what it means.
469.92	15.87	But I recently came across that word in a paper that I was reading for my class and that reminded me of how I did in fact learn that word when I was in middle school, and then I guess promptly forgot about what the word means.
485.79	1.59	So I had to search it up again.
487.38	8.48	And it means umm, I don't know, like wild, crazy, out there, mystical, kind of like that.
501.62	6.67	Uh, so I'm also wondering how much longer this is gonna take but oh well, it's okay.
508.29	1.76	I'll just keep talking.
510.05	10.93	It is... It's, it's pretty interesting to uh, try to see the flow of thought or the... Like how my thoughts process when I'm just saying it out loud.
520.98	8.35	Umm. There was a type of writing style that this relates to, I remember from last year in high school.
529.33	8.98	Umm, it's like we were reading some papers or like some stories that had this style where you just put your thoughts to paper.
538.31	3.45	Umm, and I, I really liked reading that actually.
541.76	8.75	I thought it was interesting and it was... It just really flowed from one sentence to the next, even if it was a bit convoluted, because that's fun.
553.27	6.44	I really like escape rooms, even though I'm really bad at it, it's fun.
559.71	5.22	Even though it scares me sometimes when a door randomly opens and jumps out.
564.93	15.6	And uh, when uh, I don't see the door open first of all, and that other people in front of me see the door open and then they get scared and I get scared from looking at their faces of them being scared.
580.53	5.22	And then so I get scared and turn around and jump out of the way.
585.75	1.95	But it's really just a door opening.
590.42	2.67	There's a movie with an escape room.
593.09	9.07	I don't know, they get teleported to different places, but I don't... And it doesn't... I don't know, I would watch if I had to.
