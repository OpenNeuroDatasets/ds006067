3.81	4.47	Right now, I'm mostly hearing the machine blaring into my ear.
8.44	2.45	Actually, I'm wondering if I'm talking loud enough.
10.93	5.76	Because I know that you were mentioning earlier something about making sure that I can be heard.
17.36	10.89	I'm assuming you were worried about my voice getting overheard by the machine, but then again, the microphone is literally resting on my lip right now, so I don't expect that to be too much of an issue.
31.93	1.66	It's weird to be in an MRI machine.
35.31	6.86	I don't get claustrophobic, but when I first got in, I couldn't tell if the screen was moving or staying still.
42.33	5.92	I wonder if the weird angle at the mirror was playing some weird trick on my eyes.
50.6	2.82	I'm thinking back to the beeping in my ear.
54.12	1.2	It is pretty distracting.
58.18	1.6	I'm trying to think what else to say.
59.82	9.87	I might just want to go on about what I was doing before or later, or just whatever is going on in my life in general.
71.84	8.46	After this, I have a, I think it's supposed to be a technical interview for a teaching position basically.
81.15	5.83	So theoretically, I should be studying orgo, but that's okay, I don't need to do that.
89.86	1.21	I'll figure it out as I go.
91.18	0.93	Nothing could go wrong.
96.94	4.27	Then later, I think I'm taking care of mice tomorrow, so that'll be interesting.
105.69	12.97	I think the person who's taking me to watch the mice, I think she's half out of that lab or something weird.
118.69	1.94	I really don't know what's going on with all that.
122.31	13.59	Yesterday night was the freshman formal for our class, and I was mostly there for the food, honestly,
136.13	1.92	cause I don't know anything about dancing.
139.42	1.61	It just makes me weirdly tense.
143.53	6.56	I'm trying to figure out if I'm doing this right in a sense.
150.79	3.34	If I should just be narrating or going more on thoughts.
155.15	3.17	Right now, what I'm doing is going on about thoughts, so I think that's like...
159.08	8.07	Or specifically just saying whatever comes to mind, instead of trying to remember events to talk about.
167.59	10.18	Then again, on some level, that makes more sense in order to have something specific to talk about, but I think this is specific to the task.
177.82	3.38	But also, if I literally just think whatever...
181.71	6.5	Or if I say whatever I'm thinking, I'm going to be thinking about what I'm supposed to be thinking, and that's going to go on for like 10 minutes.
190.4	2.88	For some reason, it looks like the cross is moving around.
194.69	5.2	I know it's not, and I think it's just some optical illusion, but it looks weird.
202.74	9.96	I think it's supposed to be white with a very thin layer of black around it, but I can't tell if it's just white on gray.
213.53	1.11	Like I'm imagining that.
216.93	5.68	And then you got like the little swimmy things in front of my eyes, if that makes sense.
223.93	10.84	One of my friends was talking about how she gets that a lot, because apparently some doctor told her that there's an issue with her retina, and if she looks too far, it might dislocate or something.
235.35	11.94	And then I looked it up, and there really was just straight up a picture of a retina with a large bubble under it, if that makes sense.
247.73	3.31	Okay, now that cross really looks like it's moving, but I'm probably just going crazy.
254.67	1.82	And yeah, that just doesn't seem ideal.
256.7	7.09	Apparently they were like, oh, yeah, you look too far, your retina might split in half, but try not to worry about it too much.
264.81	2.29	But it seems like the kind of shit you would worry about.
269.02	1.96	The cross is still looking like it's moving.
272.3	14.26	Now I'm thinking about, do you ever see online, those images, basically all the optical illusions, but it's supposed to be a bunch of spirals around each other.
287.23	4.25	Except I think they're circles, but if you look at it the right way or something, it looks like they're rotating.
292.84	5.27	Or like, there's another one with a bunch of spheres, basically.
299.41	5.27	I think it's like striped green and purple, and like, or no, it's like if you had a...
307.1	7.67	I forgot the word, but like if you took a hyperbola and rotated it, and then it looks like a whole room spinning around that, basically.
319.79	5.57	And we were like also talking about this all in class, which was lovely, I guess.
326.35	2.31	It looks a little more still now.
329.5	1.22	I'm like squinting at it.
334.93	1.64	Like I wonder if that has anything to do with it.
336.82	2.75	Like if squinting makes it look more still.
340.1	1.97	No, I don't think that's affecting it at all.
343.13	5.39	And it's probably messing up your images now that I think about it, so I'll stop trying to squint at that cross.
351.43	6.88	Although I think it would mostly move my skin over my brain, and it's like the brain you're looking at, so it's probably fine.
359.53	4.72	Like if me talking isn't messing with it, I don't think me squinting at the cross would mess with it.
364.69	4.16	But I'm not going to try, because it could only make it worse, theoretically.
373.84	2.43	There's like another brown dot in the corner of my eye.
376.29	0.9	I get that a lot.
378.12	13.91	For some reason, if I just stare directly forward...not like the...I think kind of like the little swimmers you get in your hive, but it's like something's like a brown dot is floating there.
393.14	6.06	And I'm not going to flick my eyes, to try to stay as still as possible.
399.84	3.91	But like if I flick my eyes, it looks like it moves, but like...
404.79	3.63	Maintains its velocity to a degree, if that makes sense.
411.7	3.37	If I'm just like staring forward, it'll kind of fall.
415.51	4.3	But then if I like look up quickly, I can like kick it upwards, in terms of like...
420.83	0.41	Field of vision.
421.94	1.66	Maybe that's not supposed to be there.
428.71	4.39	I was hearing a bunch about like the pigments or whatever that's supposed to be in like the back of the eye.
433.53	2.46	But that's behind the eye, so that doesn't make any sense.
436.08	1.34	Why would it be in front of the eye?
441.12	1.78	Now the screen looks slightly blue.
447.01	2.8	Not actually blue, like I'm pretty sure it's still gray, but for some reason...
450.13	2.17	Like I'm wondering, is it reflecting something blue?
454.43	0.83	When I move my ey...
456.05	1.18	I shouldn't move my eyes, should I?
459.28	4.05	But...It looks like it's just some like effect on my eyes.
463.37	4.69	Oh it's like a...it's kind of fading in and out, moving upwards.
469.43	9.08	I feel like I'm describing like...every...visual phenomenon that I'm not supposed to be seeing.
481.63	7.56	Like...I don't know, because I guess like a cross on a gray screen...is not the most interesting thing in the world to describe.
490.92	2.91	But like...okay, like it's still fading in and out blue.
494.89	0.81	But why blue?
498.8	3.67	Like...Or is it supposed to be doing that?
502.78	4.5	No, I don't think it's...because it looks like the sort of blue that's like...
508.09	3.51	Or like sort of color that's like not really supposed to be there, and it's just like uh...
512.5	3.4	Some trick of like...eye adaptation or whatever.
515.95	2.56	But why is it blue instead of like red or green or something?
519.32	3.72	There's something about blue cones that makes them feel like they should be bluer.
530.53	1.02	It's like a...bluish or like...I don't know if this actually just...because there's no reason to make the monitor do that.
531.62	11.81	There's no way it's supposed to be doing that.
544.35	1.36	It has to just be some weird shit.
545.83	2.1	I've been going on about that for way too long.
549.97	2.61	I guess it doesn't really matter if I go about it for way too long.
553.55	2.36	Because I'm trying to figure out what you guys...
557.5	2.56	Want in some like weird sense.
561.34	1.78	If you're trying to figure out like...
566.76	5.98	Is it just like...something about speaking thoughts aloud like...changes brain activity.
572.77	1.25	Or if you're like trying to figure out like...
574.86	2.24	When I change topics almost...
577.95	3.24	That like maybe something different in the brain happens when like...
582.33	2.49	I like change to talk about some old story.
587.23	8.79	I was...like now that I think about it...like all those consent forms like...it was listing...basically, all the experimental questions that you guys had.
597.91	5.67	And...so theoretically, I should be able to figure out why did the...
