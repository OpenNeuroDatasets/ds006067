onset	duration	transcript
2.4	12.49	Feeling cold right now, but it's interesting to see what the inside of MRI is like, because I'm usually on the outside scanning participants instead of being a participant.
16.56	25.89	Probably after this I'll have to wait for the shuttle to go back to Homewood, and then I'll probably go and walk over to the gym, and then run for a little bit, and do some weights, and then go back home, make dinner, feed my cat, and then I'll probably watch some TV, and then go to sleep.
43.81	14.56	This week doesn't seem too busy, but I'll probably have to go to work in person on Monday and Tuesday, and then probably again on Friday, but overall, it doesn't seem too bad.
58.88	10.67	And then next weekend I'll probably go to DC with my boyfriend, and go see some of the cherry blossoms, which would be nice.
70.62	8.95	And then now, still feeling really cold, but should be fine.
80.29	1.08	I'm always cold anyways.
83.57	3.67	The scanner is definitely a lot cleaner looking than the other one.
88.3	1.98	It looks really cool, and the screen is really bright.
90.99	5.86	I remember I was doing studies in here last year over the summer, and I was coming every day to scan participants.
98.46	10.15	There's always something going wrong with the projector or the coil, so we had to cancel so many times, but it looks like it's working fine now.
109.85	4.18	Usually in MR2, and in MR1 I'm working with kids.
120.53	5.31	Looks like this room has some aquarium stickers, which the other room doesn't have.
129.24	4.84	My stomach's kind of hurting though, because I had a big lunch.
135.96	9.18	And then usually lying down right after makes it hurt a little bit more, but I totally forgot to not eat that much before coming for the scan.
146.96	3.7	Which is not too bad, so I should be able to stay here for the rest of the scan.
153.54	1.11	The lunch was pretty good though.
155.12	14.76	We made udon, or curry udon, and I put some potatoes, carrots, and lotus root, and also a katsu, a pork katsu, so that was really good.
174.69	5.1	I also think my period's probably going to start today, because I'm suddenly craving a lot of sweet things.
181.24	14.25	I was walking around earlier with my boyfriend and we stopped by 7-Eleven to get some ice cream, but they were all out of ice cream and I thought I would cry, because I was so excited to get one.
197.09	2.61	Which is so stupid, because I never cry.
201.64	3.96	Not that I ended up crying, but I did want the ice cream.
207.09	1.59	Oh, well, just being a baby.
210.61	4.56	Maybe I'll go get one after the scan, or after I go to the gym, who knows.
217.75	1.91	I feel like the weekend went by really fast.
223.24	1.24	And the weather's so nice today.
225.51	4.26	I wanted to stay out longer, but I'm here now, that's fine too.
231.51	3.65	It looks like next weekend's also going to be really, really cold and wet.
237.01	4.36	But probably not as cold and wet as it is in California right now.
242.25	5.92	My parents were telling me how it was snowing in LA, which is kind of crazy.
249.87	7.62	But they live in NorCal, in the San Francisco area, so it wasn't too bad, but there's still a lot of snow on the mountains, they said.
258.54	2.24	And there was a storm there happening.
265.23	4.92	I don't think it's as bad as it was in the winter though, because San Francisco was literally flooded.
272.27	3.25	It rains once in the Bay Area, and people don't know how to act.
276.5	1.53	There's car accidents everywhere.
281.04	2.35	It's flooding up to your hips.
284.39	8.23	People were trying to get around from house to house, or get to the grocery store on their paddle boats or whatever.
296.38	3.58	Yeah, but that wasn't there, so I only heard about it.
301.82	4.12	Luckily, my flight wasn't affected by that.
308.51	4.61	That kind of reminds me that I'm probably going to go back to visit my family in May.
314.88	2.27	Go say hi to all my old friends again.
319.06	1.07	And mess around in SF.
321.38	3.67	Do some good bakeries, probably go to Chinatown.
326.46	3.1	Go to San Jose, go to Koreatown.
331.03	1.05	Get a lot of good food.
335.13	4.0	Have my brothers meet my boyfriend, which will be interesting.
340.19	1.16	Who they've never met before.
341.78	0.74	Also my parents.
343.89	2.17	But my parents aren't going to be home for a lot of that time.
347.0	0.89	They're going to be in Hawaii.
350.57	1.71	I think they're celebrating their 25th...
353.28	1.35	25th anniversary I think.
355.1	0.75	Which is a long time.
357.05	2.3	But I guess time goes by really fast.
362.22	3.98	I'm 23 now, but I still feel like I'm 15 or something.
369.54	3.39	Yeah, but still excited to go back home to see everyone.
373.98	2.27	And show my boyfriend around where I grew up.
378.66	5.83	Probably stop by the tea shop and the coffee shop that I used to work at.
385.32	1.47	Say hi to my old coworkers.
388.17	1.6	See my old classmates too.
392.49	1.79	Stop by my favorite shops.
396.37	1.23	Waste money on stupid things.
400.7	0.58	Super excited.
409.96	3.8	Besides that though, I don't know if there's much else to look forward to.
414.28	1.84	I guess I am dreading a couple things though.
417.31	6.43	Like I need to apply to PA programs starting in April.
424.41	1.07	That's freaking me out.
427.1	5.3	I always feel like I'm never going to be ready to apply.
432.62	0.88	But who knows.
434.42	2.97	Just throw my application around and see who takes me.
441.15	7.89	Hopefully somewhere either in near here, slash DC, slash Virginia.
450.0	2.56	Or back home in California.
454.96	5.56	I did think about going to school in New York, but it's so expensive to live there.
460.81	4.0	And New York's lucky kind of dirty.
465.13	4.17	So, I don't know if I want to live there for two or three years.
469.53	2.47	But this area seems all right.
472.94	1.73	California, of course, is nice too.
476.02	2.4	Weather wise it's a lot better over there than here.
480.05	3.14	Also, maybe I do prefer the west coast then.
484.11	10.35	Because flights to go to Hawaii and Korea, or actually anywhere in Asia, are a lot shorter and cheaper than it is to go from here.
495.39	5.85	Because you would have to fly over Europe or over the rest of the US to get to Asia.
503.67	3.02	So, no, ideally west coast.
506.82	3.37	But I'm cool with staying here for two or three years.
510.49	5.07	But I probably want to live in California permanently.
516.27	0.44	I don't know.
517.53	0.38	We'll see.
520.6	0.79	That reminds me.
521.84	7.44	That living in two places means doing taxes twice.
529.82	2.84	Which is also on my to-do list.
533.32	6.14	Oh, god, I need to file it for California and for Maryland.
540.52	2.06	Because I was working in both states last year.
545.34	1.01	That's going to be real fun.
547.54	5.56	I'll probably have to call my brother to see what he did for his.
553.61	2.37	Because he was living in Indiana for school.
557.42	1.1	And also in California.
561.18	1.13	I should probably call him.
564.4	1.35	He was a little bit sad last week.
566.7	2.67	Because of his flight interview.
570.22	0.74	It kind of went south.
571.83	0.84	So, he's been sad.
572.87	1.63	But I'm sure he's fine.
574.81	2.06	He has some good friends over in San Francisco.
579.44	3.12	But, yeah, I do miss hanging out with him a lot.
583.59	1.85	And I miss hanging out with my other brother too.
587.01	3.53	He's only 15.
590.84	1.45	Well, I guess he'll be 16 now.
594.9	2.3	Jeremy just said that he's getting bigger and bigger.
597.83	2.17	Apparently he's like 6'3 or 6'4 now.
