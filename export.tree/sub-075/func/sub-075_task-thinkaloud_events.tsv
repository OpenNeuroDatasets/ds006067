1.43	3.48	Okay, this machine is very uncomfortable.
5.49	4.5	The microphone is a little too close to my mouth, but it's okay.
11.53	2.02	The MRI machine is better than I thought it would.
13.55	11.56	I wanted to go here since dead mass thing, but I haven't been able to get the doctor to prescribe me a prescription to go here, or I guess a referral.
25.67	1.34	But luckily I'm doing it now.
27.63	6.0	Hopefully, no incident or anything like dead mass thing or [auntie's] thing.
33.63	5.58	Mommy talked a lot, I don't know if auntie's thing has actually, if that ever even happened.
41.07	1.35	But I think she told me about it.
42.42	2.75	I don't know if it was before or after Christopher was born.
47.93	2.11	But dead mass thing was at 18 years old.
50.04	3.39	I don't know if auntie also had something happen then.
55.41	4.38	But yeah, that was a weird dream I had last night that Steven was in.
63.97	4.36	I haven't even seen Steven since sophomore year of high school, but we barely talked since eighth grade.
68.85	2.86	And the night before, Johan was in my dream.
73.43	1.52	And I don't know, that was weird.
75.13	1.54	It was a nightmare both times.
77.39	5.38	Well, yesterday was a little less intense than Johan falling off the building.
83.93	2.42	But I don't know, maybe I should talk to them.
86.35	3.5	I haven't talked to Johan or Steven in a while.
91.49	1.94	The ride here wasn't too bad.
93.71	0.82	It wasn't too long.
94.59	1.14	I'm glad I left on time.
96.17	2.44	I was able to get pictures for a photography class.
102.19	1.12	I got pictures.
104.81	2.52	I got an email with my pictures from the lab earlier.
108.01	2.64	And that was good, except for the first one.
111.11	1.3	The exposure got ruined.
113.73	1.7	And then I ran the metal almost at that.
115.81	3.48	Those two good pictures got ruined with like a half exposure.
120.71	1.34	And I still don't know how that happened.
122.05	5.66	I think Johan told me that it could happen when light leaks through the camera at the front.
128.67	5.94	But I don't know why it would only affect half of one picture and half of the other picture.
135.29	4.94	It didn't really blow them out like I thought a full exposure would do.
140.79	3.12	It more like half imprinted another image onto it.
144.77	5.74	Which is a cool effect, but I don't know if Johan's going to like that for my first homework.
151.25	2.32	But hopefully he does, because I think the pictures look really good.
154.09	2.46	Besides the whole half exposure part.
158.03	2.06	But I guess I'll find out on Monday.
161.05	5.88	And when I get out of here I have to listen to the Horror of Dolores Roach podcast.
169.83	0.36	What do I have to do with that homework?
170.19	0.84	I have to do a plot segmentation.
171.11	0.92	I think I'm going to have to do a plot segmentation.
173.11	6.9	I think I'm going to do just the first 10 minutes and try to make it more detailed, like one to two pages.
180.51	4.42	But I don't know if I should do like the full 20 something minutes.
185.79	3.24	I might have picked the wrong podcast to do that assignment on.
190.29	3.52	But wow, my mouth is really dry.
193.83	5.68	But I guess I'll do that after leaving the lab.
200.03	2.55	I guess I'll take the bus back instead of an Uber.
202.58	2.49	I'll listen to the podcast on the way there.
206.79	2.12	Cook when I get home and then make...
209.01	1.36	Well, cook when I get home.
211.32	1.65	Start writing the segmentation.
212.97	5.12	Because I think it's due tomorrow, midday, not at midnight.
219.07	0.84	Which sucks.
221.17	2.34	Then I have to work on my drawing for Tay's class.
224.25	4.36	Oh, no, no, then I have to work on my animation for Jurenski's class.
230.79	3.7	I'm at 36 frames, I need to do 360 frames.
235.47	2.5	I need to draw all of that before the 27th.
239.19	1.58	Ah, my mouth is so dry.
244.03	1.94	Well, I got to go take the animations with Kevin.
248.39	2.5	I guess maybe we'll book the rooms back to back.
253.19	2.36	We have to take 360 pictures times two, I guess.
256.09	7.24	So that's 720 pictures of the animation, and hopefully it looks good.
264.29	1.86	I still don't know how to do the squash and stretch.
266.17	3.6	I have to look up a YouTube video on how to do that.
272.25	2.88	So that's my podcasting homework due tomorrow.
275.83	3.24	My photography homework isn't due until 2 weeks from now.
281.03	1.08	Animation isn't due until...
283.47	1.82	Well, the end of the month.
287.11	0.1	But foundation...
287.41	2.22	Oh, foundation drawing is due...
289.93	0.72	When is that due?
291.05	7.22	We have to shade in a part of the drawing before next class on Wednesday.
299.13	7.78	But she already did such a good job helping me shade my part that I kind of want to use that as the credit for the homework.
307.13	5.84	But I don't think she'll allow it since she basically helped make the shading of the wall look good.
314.61	3.88	I hope I'm not moving my head too much when I'm talking.
320.11	4.8	Yeah, but besides that, I think I get a new book, comes tomorrow.
324.97	0.76	A new comic book.
326.59	0.7	I got it ordered.
327.51	2.48	It should be parcel pending tomorrow before 8.
330.77	2.08	And tomorrow's the next episode of The Last of Us.
332.89	2.66	I can't believe it's already about to be Friday.
336.61	1.12	And Sunday's the Super Bowl.
338.35	1.72	Which I don't really care about the football part,
340.15	2.42	but I can't wait to see the trailers that come out.
342.81	2.12	I think they're going to have a trailer for the Flash movie.
345.77	1.53	And probably a trailer for something else.
347.3	1.43	Maybe the Mario movie.
349.79	1.1	Maybe the Scream movie.
350.93	1.38	I think that's coming out in March.
352.39	1.04	I have to go watch that.
354.23	3.06	But before we watch the new Scream movie, I have to go watch...
358.11	3.34	Oh, I have to watch The Original with Kevin and everyone else.
362.09	1.54	Because he's only seen the remake.
366.47	2.12	Maybe not everyone has seen the original one.
370.75	1.98	But I can't find it on any streaming services.
372.81	2.0	And I really don't want to rent it on Amazon.
376.17	4.28	So hopefully, in a couple months it comes out on streaming so we can watch it that way.
381.23	2.56	And I also wanted to watch Skinamarink.
383.98	0.89	I'm not sure that's how it's called.
385.13	2.14	I saw that it didn't have good reviews on Letterboxd.
387.89	2.36	But then everyone on TikTok keeps saying that it's scary.
391.29	6.82	So, maybe I'll wait for it to go out of theaters and come out to some sort of video on demand service or streaming.
398.91	2.46	And then I'll watch it when it comes out on that.
403.81	1.98	But I mean, I don't think it'll come out on Netflix.
405.79	4.52	I saw that it was a collaboration between Shudder and some other studio.
410.33	2.38	And I think Shudder has their own streaming services.
413.11	2.76	So, I don't know if the Shudder app has it already.
416.33	3.3	Or if it'll come out after the movies in theaters.
420.57	3.86	But I don't think there's any other good movies coming out anytime soon.
425.25	2.2	It just kind of sucks because I want to go to the theater.
427.99	2.42	Another new Spider-Man movie comes out in June.
430.69	1.44	That's after we graduate.
433.03	6.49	And then the Blue Beetle movie with the guy from Cobra Kai comes out in August, I think.
439.52	2.95	But I'll already be in California when that comes out.
444.13	3.64	And then I don't even know when to start looking for an apartment with Kevin.
447.87	5.8	I don't know if Alan wants to live with us, or if he wants to live with Leandra in Oakland.
454.05	4.74	But I mean, Kevin can't live in Oakland because it'd probably take us like two hours to get to the office.
459.63	5.36	So, we'll probably end up in San Jose having to, or I have to get a car, probably drive us.
465.63	2.08	Maybe we'll see Alan every so often.
468.49	2.19	I guess Vanessa will live with us,
470.73	4.18	which is okay because I think she's been more cool recently.
476.49	0.24	And then Alejandro's been in a mood.
477.53	0.2	I don't even know why.
478.25	0.64	I'm sure I'll find out in a couple of days when he'll tell us, I guess.
487.17	5.46	I don't even know what could be bothering him, or like what he's even doing at night.
492.63	4.78	He disappeared like at 9 p.m. yesterday and didn't come back until like, I don't even know when he came back.
498.09	6.39	I don't know if I believe Vanessa's theory about him and Kat, but I don't know.
504.48	1.79	I don't think that's what's happening.
506.97	7.62	Maybe he's like going out on walks or maybe he went to the rec center at that hour or swimming or something to get his mind off of whatever.
515.71	2.62	I have to call mommy.
518.77	6.02	Mommy said that Bobby apparently is going to DR to collect some money that he didn't even tell me about.
525.51	3.66	She was upset about that, but I don't even know.
529.45	1.48	I think she was working,
530.96	2.41	but I have to call her after this.
533.37	4.46	I don't think she's going to auntie or Robin's house anytime soon.
538.09	5.98	But I mean, if she does, I don't think she'll go actually.
544.79	3.02	I mean, I need to call them and Liam too,
548.05	3.76	because Liam called me with Helen and I never called them back.
551.85	2.09	But sometimes it's hard to talk to him.
553.94	5.05	He doesn't even want to look at the telephone or like look when we're on a FaceTime call.
558.99	5.2	He just ignores you as you're talking, which is kind of annoying.
567.33	2.1	Now this mouthpiece is really close.
571.15	2.58	I hope I'm not too loud for the people listening.
576.99	2.94	Yeah, I guess when I get home, maybe I'll take a nap.
580.93	2.2	I feel like I haven't been sleeping enough recently.
585.99	8.32	But when I go take a nap, then I actually have to go back, cook, do my... I guess I won't take a nap.
594.31	2.46	I have to go home, cook, do my podcasting homework.
599.67	2.5	And then I don't even know what I'm going to do for the rest of the day.
