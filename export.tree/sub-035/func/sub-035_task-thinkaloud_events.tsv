5.81	3.63	Uh well, it's a little loud in here, so I'm thinking about...
9.88	3.9	It's not too bad, but it's definitely capturing my attention a little bit.
15.23	13.44	Um... Let's see, I'm thinking about the run I went on yesterday.
30.2	3.08	The trees were really red and beautiful.
34.18	1.67	And it was my first run.
37.1	7.49	My legs are still sore, so it's uh it's very vivid in my mind.
46.74	3.51	The run was pretty good.
50.33	8.04	I remember running for about 1.7 miles.
59.46	7.57	The cobblestone was a little bumpy at times and I was worried about my ankles.
70.5	4.25	I'm thinking about shopping right now.
74.76	6.32	I was thinking about it a little earlier while um going through the practice.
81.19	4.06	And so I'm thinking about the Bloomingdale's website.
89.43	7.49	I'm thinking about my caterpillar that I just got named Iggy.
98.11	7.47	Um he's an invasive moth and uh I probably shouldn't keep him, but I've been...
106.13	17.79	He has his little sanctuary and I'm imagining cutting basil from my garden or my little basil plant that I have and I just drop it into his little mason jar that he's in.
124.5	4.45	Um it has some dirt in it with little sticks.
129.89	3.31	And Iggy has gotten a lot bigger.
134.02	2.81	Um I think he's going to pupate soon.
138.04	10.58	And uh I recently learned that they, the army moth worm, which is his species, they dig into the ground to pupate.
149.36	2.65	Um so I'm imagining him digging in the ground.
152.02	5.57	And he has a red type of um of cocoon.
160.41	2.45	Um now I'm imagining him eating the basil.
163.01	0.98	He eats a lot.
164.81	1.29	He eats it really fast.
166.14	3.86	So he's just chomping with his little um...
171.72	2.65	His mouth has these little hooks.
174.68	5.15	And so I'm picturing him biting all of the basil.
182.48	2.54	Now I'm thinking about my room that he's in.
185.29	8.12	Uh I'm picturing my um my kind of family room.
193.88	2.07	Uh I see my TV.
196.69	16.46	To the bottom or closer to me is the coffee table, which has a walnut um a walnut kind of leg, very organic-shaped leg and a glass top, um and under that is a snake rug.
214.28	11.63	Um and I'm picturing my toes just kind of grabbing the rug and um kind of feeling the texture 'cause it's a high pile rug, it feels really nice.
226.58	6.32	Um and the air is very still and very neutral temperature.
233.64	8.07	Um... Thinking about a lot of work that I have to do.
242.26	11.98	Um I recently... Uh last night I remember fixing a database um and my eyes are a little tired.
254.47	2.58	It's because I was fixing the database.
257.06	14.62	So I'm picturing and remembering uh editing the layout and clicking edit layout and um having to make new text boxes and database entries.
275.23	4.21	Now I'm thinking about the the beeping of the scanner.
279.64	8.27	I can hear the scanner, and my eyes, I can feel a little bit of a very light kind of tiredness, but not too bad.
290.41	8.23	Now I'm thinking about my partner, Philip, and uh just kind of walking around the house.
299.58	3.0	And I have the TV on.
304.03	7.18	It's on the show called The Mole, um which is pretty entertaining.
312.53	4.02	I'm back lying down on my couch with the computer on my lap.
322.33	2.84	Now I'm kind of listening to the beeping again.
330.29	8.27	I'm thinking about uh being on campus and um seeing my advisors.
339.53	4.61	Um I haven't seen Howard in person besides the interview.
344.33	2.07	So I'm remembering that interview.
347.06	11.94	Um he had stacks of paper all over his office, which to me was um a sign of like, oh, he's... Yeah, he's a great researcher.
359.08	3.63	He has all these papers and super experienced.
363.57	12.64	Um I'm remembering him shift and move all of his um his papers off of the only chair he had in the office so I could sit down for the interview.
377.61	21.62	Um and I asked him a lot of questions about his um food experiment with the high density versus healthy food distractors and I remember just sitting in front of him and him thinking about my questions.
400.48	3.63	And it was a really positive memory that makes me really happy.
405.2	3.63	The interview was a very happy experience.
411.91	6.01	I'm feeling how dry my lips are, remembering that I'm probably a little dehydrated.
418.82	1.79	I should probably drink more water.
421.28	1.67	Well, I need to drink more water.
423.31	4.13	Um I probably have 50% of the water I, I should be drinking.
429.0	6.64	Um and I feel kind of the crisper air in the room while I take a breath.
439.42	1.6	I'm listening to the beeping again.
444.69	1.95	I'm thinking about Philip again.
447.54	13.22	Um I'm very happy when I think about him and I'm picturing him again just walking across the um across the apartment.
464.21	9.39	Um I just remembered that I had these little surprises that I'm not going to tell you guys because it's a surprise that I want to give the department.
474.15	3.51	And I had a little survey that a lot of people filled out.
478.52	5.07	Um so I'm picturing the surprise and it's baking-related.
484.49	3.2	Um I still need to complete that project.
488.86	4.83	I just remembered I also need to come up with Philip's birthday present.
493.93	1.79	His birthday is on Christmas.
496.27	10.85	So I'm picturing a Christmas tree right now and, and pine trees and that beautiful air and a little bit of snow.
508.95	4.68	Um yeah, there's no snow in California.
514.53	12.41	So remembering the uh Davis, California Christmas which is just either cold and dry or cold and wet but not snowy.
527.8	18.1	Um there is... I'm remembering this one memory from childhood where uh when I was a kid, I was like five years old or so and it was supposed to snow once every seven years um in Davis.
547.15	5.31	And so it technically snowed, but it was like ice chunks.
552.65	1.05	It wasn't real snow.
554.11	0.49	It was just clumps of ice.
554.61	10.29	So um I remember grabbing the ice chunks and putting in my hand and the, the chunks were so um...
565.76	4.68	They were freezing and they were cutting you know your skin a little bit 'cause they were so sharp.
571.15	13.07	And um and I made a little ice ball that my sister, I remember her throwing an ice ball at me and um cutting my lip.
584.96	5.93	So I'm just remembering that very like cold kind of pain, but it was a good day.
592.88	6.01	Now I'm remembering another Christmas, but uh I think it was last year.
599.59	3.86	We're all just sitting together around the presents.
