1.62	9.65	Okay, well, so…I went for a walk with a- a good friend today and she had just had a baby.
12.6	1.04	And it was so sweet!
13.8	1.97	You know, only a few days old.
16.51	4.38	Um…didn’t really know how to exist in the world yet,
21.12	3.81	but got to meet him on the stoop of our house.
25.61	6.26	Um, it was so exciting when her and her husband moved in a few months ago, and then…turned out they were pregnant!
32.93	7.81	Uh, so we got to go for a little walk around Patterson Park, and yeah!
40.77	12.99	I am- I have been talking about having kids with my partner, and I have a lot of, um, worries and anxieties about being pregnant and giving birth.
53.98	6.66	It’s pretty crazy, um…especially approach- uh, approaching forty.
61.3	7.76	So, as they like to say in the medical industry, I am geriatric for bringing a child into the world.
70.12	3.08	I find that a little offensive- a lot offensive.
74.16	1.57	I think the term could be updated.
80.19	0.34	Um…it is very loud in here.
83.64	3.33	Uh, but I’m just gonna take a deep breath and keep talking.
88.86	4.1	Uh, yeah, it’s a little weird with my partner because he really wants kids.
93.58	13.53	It’s hard to know how serious he is, because I don’t feel like I can trust how deeply he thinks about the actual impact that it will have on our lives.
107.26	5.8	Um…what it means to bring a baby into the world and live with a newborn.
114.88	4.29	And I also worry about the financial implications.
120.34	12.28	I was in…uh, my book club met on Monday and one of the members is a psychotherapist.
133.91	11.25	And it’s always a little weird talking about relationships around her because I feel like she could diagnose you in a heartbeat, and probably does, but she’s really good and doesn’t say anything.
146.13	19.77	Uh…but talking about- talking through my feelings about how my partner feels about having kids…um, and the financial and how, you know, financial issues can be such a burden.
166.58	4.52	And it can be the thing that ends a lot of marriages and breaks a lot of families apart.
171.4	13.02	And being a single parent’s just not what I’m interested in, so…uh, I do think it’s unfortunate that raising a child in this country’s so expensive.
184.95	14.52	Um, and there’s so many expectations on the kid to- well the parent and the kid- you know, parents to pay for everything so that they get into good schools so that they are well-rounded and have all these activities,
201.73	7.49	and having been through all of that myself, I just kinda want a simple life where I hangout.
210.51	16.8	So I feel like there'll be some challenges in terms of going on playdates, and enrolling children in sports, and having to go to games on Saturday afternoon.
227.72	6.79	Um…yeah, it’s…I think having kids is enriching.
235.23	3.68	I’m not sure about having to go to all the activities, so…
239.89	6.51	um, but I do feel like my partner would be really good at all that stuff, so that makes me feel a little bit better.
248.53	6.67	Um, it does get tiring to try to talk above the abs- the sheer volume of this machine.
262.89	13.42	I think, um, one other thing I think about is, uh, the activities that I do, and how I would have to change my life around.
276.58	8.0	Right now I love to go on walks and sailing and ride horses, and I feel like a lot of that would go on hold.
285.01	9.06	Um, obviously, uh, for a while, so, um, that’s definitely something to think about.
295.58	6.29	I am turning forty this year, so I am trying to get as much travel in as possible.
302.8	6.0	I'm going to Croatia on a sailing trip in September, and I’m pretty excited for that.
310.3	10.32	Um…going with one of my closest friends that I’ve known since third grade, and yeah!
320.68	1.24	I mean, she has two kids.
321.96	6.94	This’ll be, I think, her first big vacation since before she had kids, which is crazy to think about.
331.01	3.04	I did just get back from Mexico, I was in Mexico for a week.
334.13	11.97	I was supposed to be on a surf trip, but three days in I ruptured my eardrum, and so it meant that I went for a lot of walks, tried to get some steps in.
347.53	12.96	I was on some pretty heavy- duty antibiotics, so it meant I couldn’t drink, so I would have one margarita, and- or a gin and tonic, and just kinda hang out!
360.54	12.69	Luckily I was with two of my favorite people, and, um, so it was nice to catch up with them and just get to spend unstructured time with them.
374.35	9.87	Cooking a bit, eating amazing tortillas, tacos, um…all the things that you do when you’re a surf bum in Mexico.
385.23	19.27	We have this amazing apartment where we have this amazing front patio with these huge queen size chaise lounges, and my friends could walk straight out into the water and paddle, and go surf, and I just had a front row seat to watching everyone surf.
405.79	9.82	Uh, I’d also, I brought a ton of New Yorkers, cuz those tend to pile up and the best time to read ‘em is when you’re on vacation.
416.85	3.03	Uh, I also started listening to a podcast.
420.99	13.22	It was- it’s called The Dream, and it’s about multi-level marketing, MLMs, and it’s- it’s so fascinating and also so sad.
434.33	16.19	It’s kinda very reflective of how our society treats people at the lowest end of the economic spectrum, and kind of the desperation that people are in when they turn to MLMs.
451.6	2.79	And it doesn’t even help, it just puts them further in debt.
455.72	2.91	It, uh, traces the beginning of MLMs.
459.56	2.72	I guess it was called “Magic Holiday” or something like that.
462.35	6.22	The first, it was this guy selling soaps, I think in the fifties.
469.59	12.64	And then that paved the way for Amway, which…still not sure I entirely understand what it is, but it sounds like they just sold a bunch of random household goods?
483.71	15.11	I’ve talked to- about my- with my boyfriend a bit about it, and apparently his aunt used to give them, like, toothpaste for different holidays, cuz that was part of what Amway sold, and she was wrapped up in Amway.
500.96	20.52	One of the more disturbing parts of that was…I forget, there were like two families, and one of them was the DeVoses, and everyone knows Betsy DeVos as our ex-Head of Education who was just absolutely horrific for our educational system.
522.7	12.99	Um, but yeah, so her very conservative religious family profited off poor people- probably some middle class people too- but, essentially, profited off the loss of a lot of other people.
537.09	12.83	Uh, there was an interesting FTC case, and they actually interviewed the lawyer, and he got them on a couple different charges.
550.2	9.07	All of them, except for the most important one that would have shut down all of the subsequent MLMs, and that had to do with market saturation.
560.74	12.89	And so, because even though there was vertical price fixing…and there was one other thing without the mass-market saturation, they weren’t able to say that, uh, this was a pyramid scheme.
577.96	11.47	The podcast actually started out with an interview with this woman who lived in New York in the eighties, and she went- it was like called “The Airplane Game”.
590.27	13.72	And you would show up to this room in a har- in a hotel, and the chairs would be shaped like an airplane, and there was a pilot, and…
