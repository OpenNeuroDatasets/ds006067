2.56	6.2	I can't believe Alexis sold her plant on her Facebook group.
11.52	1.67	Slipped a profit which was good.
13.64	1.78	I need to sell a couple of mine.
18.48	3.42	But that's going to have to wait because I really have to clean my fireplace.
21.9	0.66	It's a mess.
24.76	1.82	But we'll see.
27.52	4.54	I probably should dust it first because there's a bunch of dirt up there that locally you can't see.
32.86	1.68	But I know it's there and it bothers me.
35.7	3.74	And then after that I should probably clean the kitchen.
39.44	1.22	I have so many dishes.
41.96	3.16	But I did just get new ones from Ikea so that's probably a good thing.
46.16	5.64	I replaced the missing one from the set that I had originally.
53.84	0.84	But Ikea's far.
54.68	1.23	I wish it was closer.
56.72	1.46	It's probably a good thing that it's not closer.
59.28	3.22	Because then I'd have spent way too much money there but that's okay.
63.82	6.56	I did get the side table for my couch though that we were talking about.
72.36	12.14	Which was really helpful because now I can sit on my couch and have tea and not have to put it on the floor or bring in a new chair so I can work on my couch, or watch a movie on my couch and have my tea and stuff like that at the same time.
86.32	4.12	I only had one cup though this morning which usually I have more.
90.86	1.98	So, maybe I'll have more when I get home.
95.06	2.17	But I think, I don't know, the weather's been nice.
97.58	0.96	It's nice and rainy.
98.9	0.8	I like the rain.
101.9	3.7	I wish it was a little bit warmer or at least on the days that it was warm.
106.32	2.68	I wish the sun would come out so I could actually enjoy it.
109.14	6.72	Which is like, yesterday it was sunny, or it was warm, but it was raining.
117.12	1.84	And then the days that it's sunny it's cold.
120.36	1.44	So, it's like you can't have both.
123.28	2.75	We didn't get much snow this year though, which was a bummer.
126.03	0.91	I miss the snow.
127.98	6.38	Like back home in California we were getting more rain and snow than we are here which is insane.
137.04	0.86	I miss home.
138.72	1.7	My parents are building a chicken coop.
141.22	1.49	It's massive.
142.71	3.17	I didn't think it was going to be that big, but it's huge.
146.25	3.31	My mom could sleep in there if she wanted to.
149.92	1.08	It's just so big.
154.14	1.96	The color that she picked out was really nice though.
157.14	1.9	It's this blue with black trim.
163.28	1.48	And I think she's really going to enjoy it.
165.58	4.24	I know my dad's getting a hard time about it, but I know he's secretly enjoying it too.
174.82	3.3	I think they're getting six chickens.
179.24	0.51	Six or three.
179.75	3.11	I can't remember what the city's limit is on poultry.
184.5	1.0	Well, not poultry.
185.96	0.54	Fowl.
187.27	0.53	Birds.
190.14	1.42	They're considered pets I believe.
194.78	1.78	So yeah, I think they're getting six.
196.74	1.14	They might be getting three.
198.86	1.92	But that house, that coop was so big.
200.78	0.76	I bet you it's six.
203.22	4.36	And I think the store they're getting the chicks from, because they have to raise them from chicks.
208.02	7.04	I think the store they're getting them from is in Long Beach when I was seeking.
216.36	0.88	Maybe not Long Beach.
217.24	1.16	Maybe I'm thinking of something else.
218.82	7.3	I guess there's some feed store out there that they're able to get the chicks from.
227.86	4.82	But I think my mom was expecting to get the chickens from adult age.
233.76	0.77	But no roosters.
234.7	0.73	Only hens.
235.43	1.01	Roosters.
236.52	2.5	I think my neighborhood would kill my parents if they had roosters.
240.46	1.54	Also roosters means more chicks.
242.0	1.46	I don't think my parents would be able to have.
247.72	1.32	But I think they're doing better.
250.92	2.46	I don't know if they're going to foster any puppies again.
256.78	1.08	I think they will.
257.86	1.46	I just think they need time.
262.92	4.16	But I've been looking at the rescue website and there's so many cute puppies.
269.52	3.16	Unfortunately, it usually means someone gave it to them as a gift.
273.28	3.43	And they didn't want it, or they didn't realize how much work it was.
276.71	1.79	Because puppies are a lot of work.
280.44	4.62	And so, it's usually puppies that are surrendered by people.
285.34	1.8	And it's always after the big holidays that it happens.
287.28	3.0	Christmas, Valentine's, even Easter.
290.4	6.26	After Easter, there's a lot of bunnies that will be returned or given up to shelters.
298.08	3.05	Because people don't see bunnies as pets.
301.13	1.85	They see them as decoration, essentially.
303.06	1.16	Like a stuffed animal.
304.92	1.62	But bunnies are a lot of work.
307.0	2.36	They're high energy, social animals.
313.38	3.18	So yeah, after Easter there's a ton of bunnies that are just left out of shelters.
317.1	1.72	It's always the baby ones.
318.84	3.74	People just don't take care of animals the way they should.
328.22	1.34	I made broccoli the night.
329.56	1.14	It did not taste great.
330.74	1.88	I think I left them in the bag for too long.
332.7	3.08	They weren't spoiled.
335.78	0.9	They didn't go bad.
336.76	2.92	But they also weren't good, if that makes sense.
341.48	3.02	I would grow broccoli in my garden, but it's just so darn big.
344.66	1.8	It grows huge.
346.74	2.94	I don't think people realize how big broccoli grows.
351.2	2.16	But it's so tasty when it's freshly grown.
355.12	0.86	It's so yummy.
356.06	2.16	Most people don't know that broccoli is actually flowers.
359.0	7.18	If you were to let broccoli continue to grow, it would actually just be these really pretty yellow or white flowers.
367.38	1.66	So that's why they're called broccoli florets.
370.48	2.26	Because they're flowers that haven't bloomed yet.
372.74	2.72	It's just this big old bundle of pre-bloomed flowers.
376.52	1.26	They're nice and yummy.
378.9	7.06	I think in my garden I'll probably plant mostly just a salsa garden.
386.88	3.04	Different types of tomatoes, beefsteaks of course.
390.66	2.14	Nice slicing tomatoes.
394.34	1.68	Cilantro, basil.
398.04	1.76	Jalape√±o, sweet potatoes, and peppers.
401.32	3.18	I want to grow some cucumbers, I just don't really have the space for it.
404.82	7.38	But I feel like if I build a trellis and then have it grow in that arc over my garden, that'll be fine.
412.32	12.0	And then I can put lettuce or shade-loving plants underneath them so that they can both prosper from the shade provided by the cucumber trellis.
425.98	5.66	Especially now that summer's coming, I think that would be ideal.
432.46	6.32	But I'm not used to growing seasons, because in California it would always be a growing season.
438.94	0.68	Always.
440.12	2.06	But even in the winter, it really doesn't get that cold.
442.28	3.16	This year it was cold for some reason, but most years it's not.
446.26	10.4	So, I've been reaching out to some gardening friends on Facebook to see what they have to say about seasons and what to plant when.
460.08	6.6	I'm just not used to it, so I have to learn how to do growing seasons and what to grow when, and plant things out of the dirt and stuff.
470.6	1.36	Let's see what else would I want to grow.
472.18	0.92	Maybe some onions.
473.28	1.76	Onions would be good, those are really easy to grow.
478.12	1.37	Maybe some flowers.
479.94	4.16	I'll probably plant some flowers so that I can bring pollinators into my garden.
484.1	2.15	I have some watermelon seeds.
486.25	3.97	I think it would be fun to grow watermelon, I just don't know if I have the space.
491.66	2.52	Because watermelons are huge finding plants.
494.55	4.73	They grow kind of like pumpkins, but they just take up a ton of room.
499.28	3.08	They just grow along the ground and take up a ton of room.
507.02	1.08	Oh, my stomach's growling.
508.96	2.25	I had lunch before I came, I don't know why.
511.89	0.51	I'm pretty hungry.
513.28	1.2	Maybe I'm just digesting.
515.28	2.54	Maybe talking about food is making me hungry.
521.22	3.78	Oh, I got this really good tomato soup from the market the other day.
525.7	1.96	Oh, I didn't go to the farmers market this morning.
528.2	2.48	That's okay, it was raining a lot, so it's probably best that I didn't.
531.64	7.12	Because I don't know how many vendors would actually be there in the rain, or how enjoyable it would be to walk around, so I'll just go next weekend.
539.78	5.52	Oh, anyway, I got this really good tomato soup from the market.
545.95	3.93	I'm so excited to have it because it came with these sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches.
550.74	1.82	I'm so excited to try it.
553.76	3.8	The way that they gave the instructions on how to make it is kind of interesting.
558.94	6.36	Usually, you can crisp up the outside edges of the bread with some butter, but they're saying to use olive oil.
566.38	3.3	So, maybe it'll work, maybe it's something else I should try.
569.68	1.0	Maybe it's lighter than butter.
571.68	1.45	Honestly, it's probably worth a shot.
573.86	1.02	It means having less butter.
574.94	4.54	Because I haven't worked out in a week, and I should get back to doing that.
581.38	3.49	I have a little spreadsheet, I just keep forgetting to use it.
584.87	11.77	Also, I don't want to do anything jumpy or loud, a lot of things that require stomping and stuff.
