1.5	5.96	Oh, that's like the ocean when I went to Santa Cruz.
8.36	5.42	I wish I could go back to Santa Cruz on spring break.
13.82	5.6	Oh well, I went back to California. I got to see a best friend and that was really nice.
21.34	3.08	The woods were really cool and it was really peaceful.
25.24	5.38	And I wish that I could have spent more time with her there, but it was still pretty fun.
32.34	1.96	And meeting her friends was really cool.
35.36	3.2	I just wish that I could have spent more time, getting to know them.
39.58	6.88	But yes, the flight back was so long, even though it was only two hours or an hour and a half.
47.66	1.62	But yes, it was really, really long.
50.64	0.8	And I fell asleep.
51.84	1.54	That nap was so good, though.
53.84	3.22	I feel like I haven't taken a nap like that in a while.
57.8	9.76	Because, I don't know, I was just looking out the window and then I just felt tired and just fell asleep.
67.94	5.76	And it felt really good, and then I woke up a little bit later, and that was really nice.
76.28	2.66	But yes, it was a really, really, really good nap.
80.54	2.64	And I low-key probably am going to take a nap later today.
84.04	2.22	But I also have to study for chem.
86.48	2.7	Chem is honestly going to be brutal on Friday.
89.86	4.1	I don't know. I feel mostly comfortable on it.
94.66	3.1	But at the same time, I'm not really sure.
98.68	1.64	So, we'll see how that goes.
101.26	5.22	And yes, I have to review. What do I have to review?
106.56	1.36	I have to review Kinetics.
108.72	2.32	And really a lot of Kinetics…
112.08	1.52	…which will be interesting.
114.58	2.96	But yesterday during pilot, that was pretty easy.
117.96	1.92	Not easy, but it went well.
121.46	2.94	I saw Von yesterday in pilot.
125.18	2.1	He friended me on LinkedIn, which was weird.
128.24	5.38	Well, not weird because we had said hi before…
134.94	4.5	…or we had classes. What class was it?
140.46	1.86	What's the name of that class that we had together?
143.54	2.16	We had a class together last semester.
146.38	2.44	And we would sit near each other a lot…
149.36	1.36	…so we know of each other.
152.0	3.32	But, yes, him friending me on LinkedIn was interesting.
156.26	2.34	But, I mean, then again, a lot of Hopkins people friend me on LinkedIn.
159.6	4.68	And so, it's not really that weird.
165.44	2.22	But at the same time, I don't know.
173.12	1.34	LinkedIn.
175.1	2.08	I had my LinkedIn post that I made.
178.42	0.88	It was cool.
179.78	0.48	I don't know.
180.52	1.5	It was weird making it.
182.78	3.04	But at the same time, I really liked getting to make it.
186.52	3.02	And, yes, it was cool getting to present at a conference…
190.72	2.1	…and talk about public health.
192.94	1.88	And everyone seemed really engaged with it…
195.36	3.36	…except for the one girl who looked like she was falling asleep during it.
199.3	1.52	But, I mean, that's so valid.
201.18	2.56	They were there for a long time that day.
207.5	0.64	The candy.
208.26	4.36	I wish that I didn't hit the ceiling when I threw the candy out to them…
213.56	1.74	…but it is what it is.
215.8	1.88	And, I mean, they all seemed to really enjoy it.
218.76	0.92	So, yes, that was good.
220.68	5.14	And then the woman who was staffing it and being the room monitor, she was really cool.
226.2	3.62	I wish that I remembered her, though, from the online conference.
234.3	2.46	I wish that I remembered more people from that day.
239.34	4.3	Just because I felt bad that I didn't remember all of them…
244.7	2.14	…and they remember me a lot.
249.14	1.28	But, I mean, the food was good.
250.54	2.96	It was, really. The tacos were so, so good.
254.3	6.0	The food here, low-key, is– Not here, but the food at Hopkins is so bad.
262.33	4.11	Like yesterday, it literally made me almost throw up.
266.64	4.34	They had these vegetables that were– What were they?
272.1	5.62	They were boiled or steamed or something.
278.04	2.98	But they tasted so, so, so bad.
283.66	5.16	Me not being a picky eater was not relevant at all.
288.98	3.0	I took one bite of it and it was so bad.
292.92	2.52	Portobello steaks were all right, though.
296.2	2.64	And what else did I have?
299.96	1.64	The pineapple was good.
303.22	1.8	But, I mean, the pineapple always slays.
307.78	3.84	For dinner, dinner was better.
312.22	1.98	Dinner, the meatloaf was really good.
316.02	3.42	And then the pork carnitas that I had was also good.
322.14	2.06	The rice was fine.
324.48	0.94	I mean, it was rice.
326.36	6.32	And then I had these sweet potato things.
333.18	5.1	Those could have been better but, I mean, I didn't want to throw up because of that.
340.4	3.46	Oh, the Brussels sprouts last night were bad.
344.44	2.22	They were so, so, so bad.
347.36	5.98	Compared to the Brussels sprouts I had over break, they were just atrocious.
355.1	1.22	The Brussels sprouts over break were so good.
356.42	5.22	I don't usually like Brussels sprouts, but I wish that I could have those every day.
362.14	10.18	The balsamic glaze on them and the bacon and the little bit of crunch that they had also was just so, so, so good.
374.44	2.02	Yes, it was just amazing.
376.74	7.2	I don't know. The dinner that we had during break, though, at that restaurant was all right.
384.24	6.46	Last time, the lemon caper. I think it was a cauliflower steak that I had.
391.24	1.14	That one was really good.
393.22	5.18	But, yes, it had a lot of flavor.
399.0	1.58	It had lemons and capers.
401.36	8.82	And that was in the beginning of my vegetarian era, but it's not an era anymore.
413.78	2.06	But yes, it was so, so, so good.
416.78	5.96	And yes, I really liked it. But then this dish just didn't have a lot of flavor.
423.65	9.21	I sound like Carissa right now, and her food pickiness and food critic review-ness has rubbed off on me.
435.32	7.75	But yes, hopefully I get to see her today, because usually, we don't get– Actually, of course, I'm going to see her in chem lab.
443.9	7.57	Lab today is going to be interesting because it's going to be so long and it looks really involved.
451.47	2.81	And so, I think we'll probably have to stay for a full three hours.
454.92	3.63	But hopefully, it's not horrible.
460.32	5.94	But at the same time, it will probably be really, really long and really involved.
466.76	2.68	But I like labs, so it should be fine.
472.96	4.76	And then for lab, I'll probably go and take a nap.
478.4	8.62	And then I have the review session with Camille at 5:00, so I'll go to that.
488.84	6.92	Or actually, yes, I probably will go to that just for some extra help because I have no idea what I'm doing in math.
495.98	2.92	Literally, the professor is so bad.
500.5	8.02	For being a professor who's taught here for that long, you would think that the lecture size would be better…
508.52	1.65	…but it's not.
510.17	3.04	And so, tech is really coming in handy though.
513.75	4.54	And getting to just see everything worked out is really helpful.
519.29	8.48	But yes. Oh, I have to do math homework and that will take a while today. Or not today, but this week.
528.58	2.8	But studying for chem will come first.
532.34	2.44	Maybe I'll do math homework over the weekend.
535.52	8.53	Actually, yes, that's probably going to be better, except on DC, when we go to DC on Friday, depending on what time.
544.05	4.85	Oh wait, I have a party on Friday. Depending on what time we get back from DC…
549.58	2.86	…it might be too late because the party is at 9:00.
553.08	8.25	I can get back from DC, go to the party, and then maybe go to a different party as well.
562.33	0.95	But we'll see.
565.73	9.75	And then Sunday, I have to work on my paper for Sigma. Oh, I really don't want to write that paper.
577.82	4.77	The prompt makes more sense than the one [indiscernible - 00:10:00] does.
583.22	5.94	But I don't know. This week, I do not, I cannot write a paper.
590.21	2.0	I need to study so much.
593.16	3.76	And yes, I need to do a lot of work on the chem thing…
597.5	3.04	…because last time was just not it.
