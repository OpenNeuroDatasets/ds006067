2.25	7.28	That H2O show, the one about the mermaids and everything, this audio recording sounds so much like that girl.
9.79	4.8	And there's so many TikTok videos about it too, where the girl's screaming, EMMA.
15.03	1.96	And the accent's just really funny.
17.57	10.06	Thinking of this, it also seems like Australians are kind of taking over all of the actresses and acting jobs and all of that.
27.65	4.86	There's Margot Robbie, there's Chris Hemsworth, and essentially all of the Hemsworths.
33.29	1.3	And they're all really good at it.
35.31	6.02	And a lot of different people, like there's not a lot of Americans who are actors and actresses.
41.75	1.13	There's not a lot of good ones.
43.06	2.43	A lot of the good ones are all from different countries.
46.01	7.74	I think the Spider-Man movie showed that a lot, where only one guy was American, which I think is Tobey Maguire.
54.47	6.82	But it's just really funny that a lot of different people come to the United States to have these jobs.
61.81	5.54	And sometimes, being in other countries, there's so many better opportunities for them.
68.91	8.48	I think that Dunkin' Donuts that we drove past here is open, and I kind of want some coffee, but I'm on my cleanse and I can't have coffee.
77.79	1.6	I need to stick to my diet.
79.89	2.14	I need to stick to my New Year's resolutions.
82.66	3.45	I have to drink more water, I have to go to the gym more.
86.49	4.28	Speaking of the gym, I should go to the rec, but it's such a long walk.
91.05	6.52	And I'm going to go home today, I can go downstairs, but they're going to take away that gym, and it's so unfair.
97.57	4.86	I just decided to start going to the gym more, especially with my roommate.
102.57	8.34	And now I have to just say no and go walk through rec when it was right behind me, and I had no idea it was there.
111.85	13.32	But I guess workout is a workout, especially that walk to Gilman, or that walk to just campus in general, it's so far away from Homewood, and I never really thought Homewood was going to be that far.
125.17	5.52	I should have really thought about that more when I was deciding what places to go live in.
131.49	10.56	But I guess that, I think my original thought was that if I was going to walk there during the winter, it was going to suck because it was so snowy and rainy.
142.29	7.36	I don't think it's going to snow this year, it's already late January, February is just around the corner.
150.17	6.68	I can't remember the last time it snowed, I think it was late January, was it late February or late January?
157.49	6.01	The weather is always just so unpredictable, but that's what you get for living in Maryland.
163.5	11.55	We're surrounded by all these little hills, so we're super protected, but at the same time we're also always getting very random weather, it doesn't make any sense.
175.43	5.19	I think we don't have any tornadoes, but they're always are tornado warnings, and I always see those.
180.95	4.42	And I can never ever understand where they actually come from, where they're at.
185.49	9.9	I think there's a lot that happens more towards the south of Maryland, I guess there's more rural areas, there's always more tornadoes.
195.93	1.96	But I've never personally seen one.
198.07	2.02	I'm very happy that I've never seen one.
200.35	9.16	If not, I'd have to go into the basement, and my basement isn't actually protected from tornadoes, there's tons of windows, and I think that's the main thing.
209.51	1.94	There's windows and doors.
211.64	5.31	If there's a tornado, you have to go in a place where there's no doors, no windows.
217.53	4.64	But I have tons of those, so it wouldn't make any sense.
222.89	6.32	And those little shelters, they're not shelters, they're little shacks that go underground, I can't think of the word.
229.49	6.09	But they're so creepy, and every time I watch movies, there's always tons of cans and preserves there.
236.08	10.02	So, I never actually know if that's a place that people go for-I guess they stock it up in case they have to be down there for a long time.
246.29	6.13	But it never really made sense that there's always a can of peaches down in the...
252.96	2.9	It's not a shed, I don't know what the word is.
256.32	2.5	It's not a shelter either.
259.45	5.4	But it's always so dark, there's no electricity, but there's always a lightbulb hanging, and that doesn't make sense to me either.
264.89	7.26	I'm figuring if there is a tornado, and it knocks down every sort of electricity, how is there going to be a lightbulb in the basement?
272.49	6.65	It makes absolutely no sense, but movies never make sense, especially those, was it Maze Runner?
279.72	1.89	Or those Inception movies?
281.99	6.4	I guess what's the point, they're supposed to be sci-fi and all cool, but it never ever made sense to me.
289.05	9.32	I guess that's the fun of it, people watch those because they enjoy it, but I don't really get them, and I guess I'm more of an action movie kind of person?
299.49	0.46	I think it's action.
300.4	2.32	Comedy is pretty funny too, I do like comedy.
302.98	5.28	I always wanted to be a comedian, but I don't think I should actually go for it.
308.26	9.15	I've seen so many of those videos, and those comedians like Bert Kreischer and Joe Rogan, they make it seem so effortless.
317.63	4.94	But every time it's in front of all these people, I get stage fright.
322.57	5.45	I guess I'm just afraid of public speaking, I can never really do it, and so much.
328.2	2.71	I can't be organized, that's my issue.
331.01	1.36	I have no organization.
333.35	2.23	I should work on that, be better at that.
335.94	8.75	Do some practice for that, I guess it's kind of like practice, but I need to be better at speaking.
344.69	6.24	Every time I have to read in classes, it's just so terrifying for me, because I don't know.
351.07	5.88	I feel like I'm going to stutter, and if I do stutter, I know nobody cares, but for some reason I can't stop thinking about it.
357.15	5.85	I just feel like somebody's going to say something, somebody's going to smile at me, someone's going to laugh.
363.18	4.72	And I'm going to get so embarrassed, but I should just get over myself, because nobody cares about it.
367.9	7.55	I feel like they care, so it always gets me in my head, and I guess I should stop thinking about those kinds of things.
376.41	3.36	It's always so weird, especially when I'm doing Shakespeare.
380.05	2.52	Like why was Shakespeare such a dick?
382.57	16.44	I don't understand how we needed to do all those weird little, I guess it's a weird place to term for English English, Shakespearean English, it makes no sense to me when someone has the same thought.
399.49	5.45	It just seems so pretentious, and I guess that's kind of the point.
405.13	5.03	It was supposed to be for more nobler people, I think, for people of higher ranking.
410.34	3.55	But at the same time, who wants to learn that much?
413.99	11.44	Especially, it's like Latin, there's so many emperors that changed the way Latin was spoken, spoken and written, and yet, it makes no sense.
425.49	3.81	If you try to learn Latin today, there are so many different things you have to learn for it.
430.02	7.17	It's all out of order, and that's all because of one emperor who decided to just suddenly start speaking Latin in a different way.
437.73	4.32	And then everyone just had to follow suit and listen to him, and that makes no sense.
442.49	5.18	I was thinking about when, I think it was Spain, they had an emperor, and he had a lisp.
447.76	9.34	And so, everyone in Spain decided to just start talking with a lisp because they were like, oh, yeah, this is going to make him feel better.
457.37	0.95	I feel like that's a myth.
458.6	3.63	But at the same time, if that's true, that's so dumb.
462.49	12.01	I don't understand how one person's, I guess, not power, but just the way that they act or something that they like or something that they do just sticks, and it sticks for centuries.
474.5	4.42	Because now, people from Spain have the lisp, still.
479.41	2.23	And I don't really understand why they keep it.
481.73	2.4	Because it's so simple to just do an S sound.
484.86	5.57	And I know they can because I talk to so many Spanish people.
490.98	2.94	And when I make them try to do the S sound, they can do it perfectly.
494.0	3.21	So, it doesn't make sense why they continuously do the lisp.
497.49	8.4	But I guess that's just how they're raised, they're raised with that accent, like Australians, or like British people, they're raised with it.
506.49	2.05	That kid, that's so interesting.
508.82	7.49	That lady, I think her name's Terry Irwin, she's from Oregon, and her kids are.
517.26	6.03	The father of those children, Steve Irwin, he's famously Australian.
523.46	11.43	She's from America, yet every time there, you see the two kids, it's so interesting how both of the kids have more of an Australian accent, yet they're raised with their mother.
535.49	6.36	And so, it's like, is it that they listen to more people in the Australian accent, that's how it was picked up?
542.3	6.25	Because I feel like if your mom speaks in a certain way, if your mom has a certain accent, you would pick up that accent.
548.55	7.94	Like when I speak Spanish, I speak with an accent, or at least I try to speak with an accent, and I usually feel like it follows my mom's accent.
556.63	9.43	So, it doesn't make sense to me how they've been raised by her their entire lives, they're like 20, 18, 19, 20, I can't remember how old.
566.56	9.07	Yet they speak with a full Australian accent, and it's not even like certain words seem more American or certain words have more of an American accent.
576.4	6.4	They just speak like they come from two parents that are fully Australian, and that's not the case.
583.52	9.85	And it's so interesting how they still live over there, and that they've never really come back to Oregon, because Oregon's such a pretty state, too.
593.49	4.32	If my brother's over there, then I should go see my brother.
598.03	6.86	I think I was going to go this winter, and I decided not to, because I just didn't have enough time.
