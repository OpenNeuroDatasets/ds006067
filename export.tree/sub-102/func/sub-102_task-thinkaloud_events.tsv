4.38	5.52	Food, I'm hungry, my stomach is feeling empty.
10.74	5.16	I'll go around and maybe I could eat, but the menu would...
17.72	3.12	Okay, I know they have cool stickers, so maybe I'll go there after here.
23.6	4.72	I'm not sure what else I could eat, but I think those mussels is what I want.
29.28	5.74	Also, I've heard that they're closing, so maybe I'll go there.
36.12	5.38	I also have to finish my pranks, so...
42.96	1.64	We'll see what time I get out of here.
46.58	1.02	And then decide.
47.94	1.94	We also have food at home.
50.96	1.02	I didn't have to cook.
59.18	0.4	And I did eat out yesterday, and the day before.
61.36	1.28	And the day before?
64.18	1.5	No, not the day before.
67.88	1.2	But then we're going out tonight.
70.28	1.24	So, maybe I'll just eat at home.
72.7	2.62	But I only had two apples for breakfast.
83.56	0.36	So, maybe I can let myself eat out again.
88.74	5.48	Sandwich with strawberry, and rye, mustard.
95.08	1.14	Sounds kinda of good.
98.38	2.08	Some tikka masala.
101.26	1.26	Also sounds good.
104.76	2.36	I don't really know what that one would be.
107.94	1.5	No, I'm hungry.
113.78	1.76	I feel like I'm in a cocoon.
116.26	1.5	It feels really safe in here.
118.58	5.74	And comfortable, and I could just fall asleep, but I won't fall asleep.
125.26	4.36	It feels like cozy, and nice, and yeah.
130.72	0.84	Comfy.
136.08	2.0	It's pretty cold outside, so I don't really feel like going outside.
138.36	3.16	It's going to be like 30 tonight, which is going to suck.
143.68	2.68	My windows might be cold.
147.64	1.66	I don't have the heat out, but it's dry.
156.04	2.9	I'm trying to figure out how to harvest the mushrooms.
161.76	4.6	I'm trying now, but hopefully it'll do well with the added water.
167.98	4.22	I need to cook this, so hopefully the first spring break will be ready.
174.96	1.98	It's a lot, though.
177.82	3.2	I might have to dry some, or just cook it all.
182.62	1.8	I don't know how it works.
185.02	1.92	We'l see what I can cook with it.
186.94	4.18	I'll probably just pan fry it with some olive oil and salt.
193.38	1.56	Make sure what else I can make with it.
196.48	1.42	I could look up recipes too.
198.48	1.74	Or you could just dry it and put it in...
202.66	2.06	I don't know, just mix it with the food.
204.82	1.34	See how that goes.
207.6	1.86	I don't really remember what it tastes like either.
216.54	1.82	I need to look into that.
221.4	1.92	So, spring break is in one week.
225.12	2.14	I'm not trying to go home.
228.94	2.58	All right, let's see what happens.
236.66	2.92	I need to figure out the meeting for...
241.76	2.74	I haven't studied, but what am I doing now?
246.74	4.36	I'll just figure out what time to get out of here first, and then we'll see.
253.26	2.28	Maybe CVA to finish.
257.62	0.08	Or food.
257.82	0.66	Or both.
261.34	0.4	Maybe I'll go home.
261.74	1.0	I think I still want to go to the gym.
265.82	0.04	Maybe.
272.14	0.08	Let's see...
272.4	0.96	Potentially.
276.52	3.52	4:35ish.
280.7	2.58	Then, oh, I have to ask Alan if he cooked.
286.26	1.64	And then, what is he going to be doing?
288.52	3.32	Maybe cooking and then I guess...
297.12	0.12	There's enough meat.
298.36	0.16	It's not enough tortellini.
299.26	0.94	It should be good though.
301.56	2.12	Maybe some mushrooms would be good with that too.
303.76	2.16	Maybe I can just buy it from somewhere.
309.26	2.32	Let's see how that goes.
314.26	1.54	Let's see what I get for my pie.
318.76	2.32	I have to eat something with my pie.
322.26	3.22	Is that already like 2.30?
328.0	0.71	I have to eat something.
328.71	0.69	Do I have to eat something with my pie?
333.14	0.12	I guess not.
335.16	0.08	I should.
336.7	0.32	I should eat something with my pie.
337.02	0.24	Let's see how I'm at 5.
338.62	1.52	Maybe I'll eat again.
343.1	0.12	Then, let's see.
345.04	0.28	6, before I go to the gym.
347.04	0.28	I'm going to the gym at 6 till 7:30.
349.04	0.28	Get home, shower.
349.32	1.76	See what I'm going to wear for tonight.
353.24	1.08	See what I'm going to be eating.
362.46	3.52	I don't know what time I'm going to the auto bar.
367.44	1.14	10:30, 11.
370.08	2.02	I have to pay Kevin back with the ticket.
375.06	1.28	Maybe I can just buy a tix.
378.32	0.9	I'll figure it out.
380.54	0.68	What else should I do?
384.32	2.6	Shit, I forgot to look up the fixation point.
390.24	0.92	I guess it's okay though.
391.7	2.46	Because it's part of the study.
399.02	3.8	It's kind of hard to think on the spot when you're so uncomfortable.
403.76	0.74	I just want to sleep.
407.94	3.4	Close your eyes, fall asleep, and goodnight.
414.2	1.56	I don't know why I'm always so tired.
416.46	1.72	Maybe I haven't done too much.
420.1	1.12	I was sick last night.
421.24	3.6	Like 2:30, woke up at 9.
426.16	0.12	10.
427.26	3.06	That's a good 7 plus hours.
431.88	0.61	Is that enough?
432.6	0.48	Maybe.
435.58	1.26	Should be.
438.7	0.5	I don't know.
440.28	1.96	But the gym takes a turn too.
444.18	0.86	I guess it's okay.
445.26	1.5	I should get checked out.
447.8	0.78	By the doctor.
451.08	3.06	I think I need to increase my dose.
458.36	2.14	Wow, saying that, this is really kind of crazy.
467.22	1.42	I'll fix all of them.
468.64	3.78	I definitely want to make one of the mochi stamps.
472.62	3.42	Not the mochi stamps, the paraka stamps.
476.26	1.48	Cylinder stamps.
484.68	0.44	Maybe I'll try to make a color print of the mochi.
488.0	1.14	Something with red.
489.48	1.9	Maybe a red and black would be cool.
493.12	2.68	I definitely want to start putting on the toe pads again too.
497.02	2.5	Maybe some sweatpants or a shirt.
500.84	3.94	I should have bought that shirt yesterday because it would have been good to pair with the gray.
505.7	2.48	Maybe white or black.
509.72	2.9	Black, shirt, white.
512.74	1.88	Would red even show...
516.0	0.04	Okay.
518.12	1.08	Yeah, white first.
519.62	1.62	Then print color on top.
523.22	1.84	Maybe just one color.
526.86	1.02	Just one screen.
529.46	1.54	Let's see if that's burned.
531.46	0.68	I think it is.
535.64	1.06	I need to fix my screen.
542.6	3.04	That should be quick though, it's on a small screen so it's easier.
547.2	3.76	It's just one more layer, it's a black layer so it should be easy to line up.
553.88	0.86	How many prints do I have?
556.04	1.18	15-ish?
558.04	0.8	No, maybe less.
562.04	0.3	12?
563.32	1.9	I need to practice on the other pieces though.
565.82	3.4	So, I can get it right and then I can do it on the real papers.
570.04	1.04	Because that doesn't look stupid.
573.88	1.34	I mean, McDonald's is right there.
576.24	2.12	McDonald's is here.
580.1	2.78	Kumaito was really good yesterday.
583.42	1.04	It was so expensive.
584.76	5.18	16-something dollars, it wasn't a lot of food but it was a good amount.
593.12	0.16	It was really good.
593.28	1.08	I need to print cash.
595.4	3.01	There's no Bank of America nearby.
598.41	1.63	Dang, there's no ATM.
