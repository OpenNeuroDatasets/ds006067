2.19	12.04	So, I'm thinking about how I'm in an MRI scan and that reminds me that my grandpa recently got an MRI scan, and he'll be getting surgery soon on his spine.
14.69	8.11	And MRI scans also remind me of my mom, how a few times she's gotten a few MRI scans.
24.57	10.12	And that just reminds me about a time that she got sick and then how it turned out to be a condition that might be hereditary.
35.77	3.0	But I don't really know what happened to the results of that.
40.51	11.6	That reminds me how I just went to the doctor for a physical and how hard it was to get an appointment, and how it's been like that ever since COVID started.
52.95	2.0	It's really hard to book appointments now.
55.41	13.28	It just makes me think about whether it's like that in other doctor's offices or not, or if it's just my doctor's office, and whether that will change anytime soon.
71.97	10.74	Then that just makes me think about healthcare and whether I want to go into healthcare, because I'm currently just trying to figure out what I want to do with my life after graduation.
84.51	11.07	I'm not really sure whether I want to continue with medicine, or if I want to go into psychology because this past year I was able to take more advanced psych courses and I really like those.
95.67	5.08	But I'm also done with all of my pre-med requisites, so I could continue with medicine.
101.41	19.18	But I think the best thing would be for me to just try to get different experiences and see how everything plays out, what I like more, what I don't like, but at the same time that makes me feel like my life is on hold and I'm not really going anywhere.
121.25	4.9	I don't really know if I'm going to end up just taking one gap year or if I'll need to take multiple gap years.
126.61	1.02	That's kind of scary.
128.95	4.78	And then I don't know how my family is going to think about it, whether they'll be supportive or not.
134.37	5.8	I don't know if I'm going to end up having to go back home after I graduate and live with my parents.
140.17	2.34	I don't know how that will be like.
144.21	15.3	At the same time, I'm excited to graduate and do all the senior traditions this semester, and just spend the last couple of months with my friends and make new memories.
160.19	13.36	I want to try to do better academically, but I also want to have new experiences and do things that I won't be able to do outside of college once I graduate.
174.25	4.16	I do regret not being able to study abroad while I was an undergrad.
178.47	3.2	That was something I really wanted to do, but then I wasn't able to.
181.93	6.5	Part of it because of COVID, and then part of it just because I wasn't on top of the deadlines for applying.
190.45	12.4	But I'm glad I did get to take more Italian courses at least because I've been interested in Italian for a while, and I've gotten better at it now that I've been at Hopkins.
204.89	10.36	Hopefully, I do get to go to Italy or to any other Italian speaking country in the near future so I can actually practice it.
216.99	11.12	It's not the same just learning the language in class than being able to actually speak it in the country or speak with other people.
229.75	6.08	Like when I went to Italy, my sophomore year of high school, that was really fun.
236.01	11.1	And it was kind of hard because it's not the same as being in a class and being able to look something up really quickly, but it was a good time.
247.65	10.08	I really liked getting to challenge myself and meet new people, and hear different accents.
259.27	1.5	I do want to go back there.
261.11	8.76	I also haven't really kept in touch with the friends I went with, so it'd be nice to get back in touch with them.
271.85	15.22	That reminds me that my friend, Grapeet, is actually in Italy, in Florence right now for intercession, so I can't wait to ask her how that went and find out whether she liked it or not, whether she learned any Italian or not.
288.39	3.4	I know she said she was having some trouble adjusting to the food.
293.56	7.29	And she had a lot of work, lots of different papers to do, but hopefully she was able to enjoy it overall.
303.09	13.52	Thinking about college also reminds me how I just helped my sister finish her college applications, and how when I was helping her it felt like it had been such a long time since I had submitted my own college applications.
316.95	4.42	I couldn't remember a lot of what I did or how I figured things out.
323.05	9.34	It also made me think about how I really had no one to guide me through the process, and I'm glad that I was able to guide her through the process.
333.88	9.95	Because I remember feeling very clueless and not really knowing what I needed to do, who I needed to contact, what I needed to submit, things like that.
344.77	2.78	So, I was able to help her in that.
348.85	5.38	But I also wish she hadn't waited until the last minute to get most of her things done.
355.65	3.82	Because last weekend we had to stay up pretty late working on things.
359.73	6.14	She's also thinking of applying to some art schools, so she was working on her portfolio pretty last minute.
366.23	5.9	Her paintings came out pretty good, but she thinks they could have been better.
372.85	10.66	So, I wish that she had started with more time instead of waiting until the last few weeks of until her college apps were due.
384.19	12.8	But I really hope she gets in to wherever she wants so that she can have a good college experience like I've had, and that she gets to study whatever she likes.
403.27	2.1	I know my parents don't really want her to go into art, but that doesn't matter.
405.95	10.26	I prefer for her to go into something that she's interested in instead of just trying to satisfy whatever they want.
419.61	12.14	At the same time, I'm also excited that I'm graduating college while she's graduating high school, and hopefully we can plan a trip over the summer to celebrate our graduation.
432.35	12.14	I'm also glad that our fear of having our graduations be on the same day wasn't necessary because they ended up being a week apart.
444.71	1.34	So that'll be good.
446.61	6.08	Our parents will be able to go to both of our graduations.
453.53	8.72	Yeah, hopefully we can have some of our family members fly out from our extended family.
462.73	3.58	I know some aunts and uncles that would love to be there.
467.65	7.54	And then I know that my mom wants to throw us some sort of graduation party or dinner.
475.49	14.68	My sister doesn't want us to have one of those, but I don't know, I'm okay with it as long as it's something pretty small and it's not too big.
491.91	2.8	But I think it'll be okay.
498.89	12.18	That also made me think about how she wants to get a job soon and how before that, the first thing she needs to do is get her driver's license.
511.13	7.18	I wasn't able to take her practicing too many times over a break, but I hope she goes more often with my dad.
518.79	6.54	I get kind of nervous when she's driving and I'm in the car with her just because I'm a really anxious person.
526.91	1.14	But she's doing pretty good.
528.14	4.0	And I'm glad that she's finally taking the initiative to get her driver's license.
534.09	11.11	Because it would make her life so much easier, transportation-wise, by getting to and from school so she doesn't have to wait outside in the cold for the bus.
545.2	12.51	That reminds me of how convenient it was for me to get my driver's license early because I hated waiting outside in the cold or just getting to school late in high school because I'd wait for the bus.
559.45	15.22	And it also allowed me to have an internship at UMD, and I was able to do research there and just having a driver's license facilitated all of that just made it so much easier.
575.77	7.6	So hopefully, my sister can do the same and she can find a job or internship that interests her.
583.61	5.78	I'm just really excited to see what ends up happening, what she ends up doing.
591.71	20.1	And I'm also hoping that this summer we could take a trip either back home to Guatemala to visit our grandparents or to another country.
