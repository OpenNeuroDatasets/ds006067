2.02	5.78	I'm thinking about my day today and what I have to do.
7.9	10.76	I went home for a break and it was good to see my family. And then I saw my cousin and stayed with her in DC, which was fun to see her.
18.96	6.74	And I'm excited about this weekend because I get to see my grandmother and go to Florida, and I'm excited for the warm weather.
26.56	13.44	I'm also happy because my roommate just came back from a trip, so I'm excited to spend time with her. And she's also bringing her dogs over tonight, which I'm excited to see her puppies.
40.3	1.3	They're two little puppies.
41.88	3.9	One of them is five months old and the other one just turned one.
46.44	2.7	And so I'm excited to hang out with the puppies.
51.86	1.22	I'm also ready to graduate.
53.36	4.06	I'm graduating in May and I'm excited to leave Baltimore.
57.78	6.2	I'm excited to spend the summer with my family and move to New York City in September.
64.74	4.88	I'm also excited because I'm moving in with two of my best friends.
71.26	2.52	I'm also thinking about what I'm going to eat for dinner.
74.68	2.53	I think I'm going to make some chicken tortilla soup,
77.35	2.95	which is one of my favorite meals to make.
81.38	4.98	I also am thinking about what I'm going to have for breakfast tomorrow.
86.46	3.74	I think I'm going to make oatmeal because I just bought oatmeal.
91.12	2.76	I also want to make cookies soon.
95.34	2.48	I'm also thinking about this show.
98.34	10.82	My roommate and I just finished watching The Last of Us last night, and we both really liked the show. So, I'm thinking about how that show was fun to watch.
110.32	4.46	Right now, I'm rewatching Grey's Anatomy, which this is reminding me of.
121.22	9.15	I am also thinking about lacrosse because my roommate and I, who's one of my best friends, are playing lacrosse on the club team together.
130.78	3.58	She used to play on the varsity team.
135.02	12.74	Also, what I'm thinking about is one of my best friends from home's birthday yesterday, and we're planning a joint graduation party this summer because she's also graduating for her Master's.
147.76	4.42	She's graduating with a Master's in Bioinformatics.
152.7	6.14	And so, we're going to host a joint graduation party at her house, which is fun because she has a pool.
159.78	5.7	The only thing is, my mom doesn't like her dad so I don't know if my mom will come to the party.
166.16	2.3	But I think a lot of my friends will come up.
169.34	3.52	I'm also excited because two of my best friends were abroad this year.
172.86	8.32	One of them is in Taiwan doing a Fulbright, and she's been there since June and she'll come back in August.
181.8	3.58	And so, I haven't seen her in a while and I'm excited for her to come back.
186.28	3.14	My other best friend, Gracen, is in Paris.
190.3	4.04	She's doing a Teaching Assistant program, teaching English to French students.
195.3	8.26	She's been there since October, but I saw her in January because I went on a trip to Europe and visited her.
203.84	4.88	I was in Europe for a school trip to Israel, which is not in Europe.
208.86	2.49	But I was in Israel for a school trip for two weeks.
212.3	2.41	And then we had two weeks until break was over.
214.93	2.13	So, my roommate and I went around Europe…
218.24	4.02	…and we visited Gracen in Paris, which was really fun.
224.02	3.22	And we also went to Spain and Amsterdam.
228.1	5.38	But that was my old roommate, and she moved out because I scream in my sleep.
234.34	2.4	So, she is no longer my roommate.
236.97	9.17	But it's fine because my new roommate is one of my best friends, and it worked out well because she was moving out of her apartment in DC.
249.68	7.12	I really liked Israel, and also, I think my favorite country to visit was Amsterdam.
256.8	1.58	I really liked the food in Spain though.
258.42	5.64	I had a lot of octopus because octopus is my favorite meal or one of my favorite foods.
264.6	2.34	My other favorite food is lobster.
267.18	3.46	I really like lobster because my family goes to Maine every summer.
271.87	5.17	And we always get a ton of lobster when we go because my grandma has a beach.
277.45	5.53	Her family has a beach in Maine, so we go because it's our own private family beach.
283.8	4.94	And we're going again this summer because we go every year for my grandpa's birthday.
289.78	5.92	And this year, he's turning 92 or maybe 93.
296.12	5.96	I just saw my grandparents last weekend when I was home in Boston.
307.12	1.89	My grandparents live in New Hampshire and we went to this restaurant. That was really nice.
309.15	3.13	It was supposed to be a low-calorie restaurant, which was funny.
313.8	4.03	It was fun because my grandma and my mom and I all got drinks.
319.15	4.35	And then I went out in Boston with my friends because it was St. Patrick's Day.
324.59	4.02	And I met one of my friend's old roommates or new roommates.
328.75	4.53	She's going to move in with them in September, and there are five of them.
334.37	5.99	Two of them, my friends and I didn't like, so we'll see how that goes because soon, she'll be living with them.
342.22	7.8	We also ran into some friends from high school, which is funny because I haven't seen them since freshman year of college.
350.43	2.17	So, it's been five years since I've seen them.
354.1	7.21	And I'm just really excited to be home for the summer because I haven't really spent a summer at home.
362.31	2.53	All of my summers, I've spent in Baltimore.
365.88	2.76	Freshman year, I took Orgo so I was here.
369.16	8.78	Sophomore year was COVID, so I guess I was home for that. And then junior year, I worked remotely in Baltimore.
378.2	7.42	Senior year, I also worked remotely in Baltimore. So, this year will be my first summer where I'll be home for the whole summer.
386.72	11.21	I'm also excited because my friends and I are going to go to a country concert this summer, which is fun because we went to the same concert after senior year of high school.
398.97	4.17	So, it'll be like a reunion back to that.
404.19	5.12	And we're also going to another concert in August, which is one of my favorite artists.
410.67	1.92	And I'm really excited for that concert.
412.77	3.4	It was really hard to get the tickets because of Ticketmaster.
417.67	3.54	All of the tickets, there were three days of sales…
421.52	5.99	…and my friend and her boyfriend and I all tried each day to try to get tickets for the concert.
428.55	4.81	And each day, none of us were able to get tickets, except for the last day.
433.54	3.95	I was able to get three tickets, except they aren't next to each other.
437.62	18.61	So, we're all going to have to sit in different seats at this concert, which is interesting because he's not that big of an artist, so I was confused why his tickets were selling out so fast.
456.23	3.67	I'm excited to be home too because I want to see my family.
460.68	7.6	My youngest brother is going to be a senior in high school and my middle brother is going to college next year.
470.1	13.86	He, I think, is going to college locally in Massachusetts, which will be nice. And he's going to have his high school graduation party too, which will be fun.
484.94	3.77	My cousin is also graduating from business school this year.
488.84	4.67	So, my grandma has three children, grandchildren graduating this year.
494.42	3.76	And I really wanted to go to his graduation because it's in Atlanta…
498.46	1.4	…and it would be fun to go to Atlanta.
500.86	3.64	But his graduation is during finals week.
505.64	3.11	My whole family is coming for my graduation.
509.84	12.64	And then the Thursday of graduation week, my dad and I are going to pack my apartment into a U-Haul and drive back up to Boston, which will be fun.
522.48	19.3	And then Memorial Day weekend, my roommates are my two best friends. My roommates that I'm moving in with in New York are my two best friends who are in Paris and Taiwan, and then Gracen's best friend from home, Sasha.
541.78	4.37	Sasha lives in LA right now, but she doesn't like it so she wants to move back to New York.
547.0	12.12	And we all want to move in September, and so Sasha always has a Memorial Day weekend party.
559.6	5.19	She lives in Westport, Connecticut, so we're going to go to her house for the party.
564.96	2.36	And then that weekend, we'll look for apartments in New York.
568.46	3.92	And I'm excited to move to New York because a lot of my best friends live there.
573.18	3.44	My Big in my sorority lives there and she loves it,
577.66	4.64	and so I'm excited to be living in a city with all my best friends.
584.86	6.82	I'm also excited because it's closer to home in Boston, so I can visit my family and my friends from home a lot.
592.28	9.72	I'm also excited to see my grandma this weekend and to be in the warm weather, because I didn't really go anywhere warm for spring break.
