3.24	4.53	Um so sorry it's like kinda hard to think because it is so loud.
10.96	1.1	I guess like I miss my dog.
12.37	2.03	Cause the dog in the lyft was really cute today.
15.53	0.85	His name is Birdie.
16.54	0.9	He's a golden doodle.
18.35	2.9	He's like two years old now because I got him during COVID.
21.89	8.82	Um he is really cute, but I feel really bad because I think right now, like, my parents are really busy, so he's not like having a lot of fun I guess by himself.
31.31	3.21	So, I think I'm gonna visit during him, I'm going to visit him during fall break,
35.3	5.96	Umm and then, during fall break, I kind of forgot that it was this weekend, which is super nice.
41.42	6.23	Cause I really need a break cause I'm kind of tired and like, I don't know, schools just school which is rough.
48.43	6.33	Speaking of school, I guess I have orgo lab report due um tomorrow morning.
55.52	3.07	So I need to work on that tonight after this is over.
59.12	4.83	Um, but I'm gonna work on it with some of my friends so kind of excited about that
64.29	4.51	Cause I don't know I guess it's just like fun doing stuff with likeâ€“ studying with friends.
70.27	9.72	Um I don't know I also need to really study for orgo cause that's kinda scary and stressful I'm super behind on reading for the chapter.
81.19	11.46	Um but at least like lectures are in person which is super nice cause then um I actually like go to class and like I have to wake up and I can't just like sleep during a zoom which is super helpful.
93.58	4.0	Um, I think I probably should call my parents today.
98.67	4.77	Um I'm gonna go like, I don't know what should I eat for dinner?
103.79	1.01	I have to think about that.
105.4	6.25	I really like planning like meal planning things so like my whole Instagram is just like food which is super fun.
112.03	7.86	But I want to go like to D.C. for fall break and like go to some nice restaurants or something and like drink coffee
120.65	9.61	Um my favorite coffee is lavendar coffee like I like getting an iced um latte with lavender and oat milk from bird in hand which is right across the street from Commons.
130.81	3.83	But they are always out of lavender every single time I go which is super annoying.
134.89	11.78	Cause like I've had their, like weird caramel syrup or something that has coconut in and it tastes like beans for some reason but like not like coffee beans, just like weird like canned pinto beans which is not.
146.96	1.12	I don't know like it kinda just sucks.
152.21	6.75	I don't know I had like coffee today, but i left it on my desk and i didn't have time to drink it so I'm just gonna like microwave that later.
159.46	3.02	I also have like a ton of dishes to do which is also really annoying.
163.21	5.91	Because no one in my suite ever does dishes so we need to get on that
169.34	4.69	And then I don't know, there's like some random kid from CMU visiting right now.
174.64	0.6	I don't know why.
175.33	1.78	He's like one of my roomate's friends.
177.27	5.14	But he 's just here and I was like why are you here like why would want to visit but it's whatever.
183.59	5.33	Ummm and then, i don't know this week is kind of boring for me I think I'm going to go...
190.98	3.08	Home, I have to ask my parents about that.
195.03	3.81	Ummm I don't know maybe call my sister.
200.13	2.16	Um I don't know I feel like my life is pretty boring.
208.36	5.09	Shoot, I feel like it's really hard to think of stuff like nornally especially for like 10 minutes which is like...
214.13	7.45	I don't know 10 minutes is a pretty long time to just like talk like, just talk for 10 minutes straight especially if there's like beeping I guess.
222.56	3.63	But i don't know I feel like coming up with ideas is actually like super hard.
226.35	2.97	Because I remember like last year I took oral presentations as a class.
229.96	3.57	And they were like, oh come up with your ideas and like what to present.
233.68	2.76	And like hmm I don't know what to present about so I have to come up with ideas.
243.41	7.99	"One of my- I told one of my friends, I was gonna like get my brain scanned today and they were like ""Oh that's cool cause one of my other friends also asked me to do that."""
251.55	1.26	"And they were like ""are you in the same lab?"""
252.94	8.19	"And I was like ""no"" but they're in like the same frat and um it's cause they're in like a different lab doing like BME things."
263.48	3.55	Um, shoot I feel like my life is so boring.
268.07	4.02	It is also like really loud and hard to focus a little bit, I guess.
272.91	1.71	Um my sister has a cat.
275.45	1.29	The cat's name is wasabi.
277.58	1.77	And she is also like two years old
279.54	4.45	I think she was like born in July or something like that, but my sister rescued her last- like two years ago.
284.84	1.84	Um her cat is so cute.
286.84	8.13	Like I was on facetime with her yesterday and like whenever we were talking like we were just like watching her cat and it was so like, wow, I really want a cat
295.39	6.34	Um and then we were talking like oh we should do like a sushi theme for cats so we can do like, wasabi, obviously.
302.08	2.21	And then you can get like a black cat and name it like soy sauce.
304.64	2.28	Or like a green cat or not a green cat I don't think those exist.
306.95	2.25	Or like an orange cat and name it ginger.
310.16	1.76	Or like tuna or something.
312.01	1.13	I think that'd be super cute.
314.15	6.0	Um I don't know I feel like having pets is super nice, but that also, it's like, kind of takes a lot of time
321.39	4.05	Um I remember like growing up my parents never wanted to have pets but now like we have a dog
326.08	1.62	And they are like obsessed with him.
327.95	6.11	And like they are so cute and he's so spoiled because of that, but like it is what it is, like he's so precious.
349.02	4.82	Um this weekend I kind of just like stayed home, studied.
354.37	2.4	I skipped chapter meeting yesterday.
358.07	4.98	Um, but that's okay because I was like, I really don't want to play soccer.
364.05	5.62	Um and they're like come play soccer, with phi delt people for fundraising, and it was definitely not.
373.76	5.33	I don't know it's just really nice to have like a little bit of a calmer week this week because I don't have exams this week.
380.19	1.86	Um do I have an exam next week?
382.09	2.44	I think i have an exam next week for orgo which is why I need to study.
388.23	1.9	ugh ten minutes is so long.
396.34	1.42	I kinda want to go shopping.
398.85	1.28	I feel like it is getting cold now
400.35	1.36	I don't really have enough sweaters.
402.31	7.57	So I kind of just wear like the same sweatshirt, like comfy sweatpant duo, like- trio I don't know- set like every single day.
411.11	3.11	Um I need to wash my comfy every cause it is getting gross.
414.71	2.46	And then, I probably should wash my sheets too.
417.98	7.05	I don't know I feel like life is just like a constant struggle of like trying to be like clean and like clean up after yourself after doing things.
425.92	0.88	It is really annoying.
430.31	5.77	I have takis I wanna eat, I also have like kimchi I wanna eat.
437.42	3.92	Um ya I also need to figure out housing for next year.
442.48	2.6	Which sucks and then.
450.68	4.65	I want to go grocery shopping, buy some fruit or something like that.
458.72	1.36	There is this tea I wanna buy.
460.4	1.57	But it's like this specific type of tea.
462.12	12.12	It's like this korean like, honey citron tea where they like have citron, which is like a special fruit like a citrus fruit but not really like a lemon like it's a little bit different.
474.99	7.39	Umm and they just like put in honey and sugar and then you just add hot water, and it's like a little nice like citrus tea.
482.79	1.05	It doesn't have caffeine
484.01	1.81	And it like kinda helps your throat feel better.
486.81	1.93	Since everyone is getting sick.
493.73	3.82	My sister gave me a Starbucks Giftcard yesterday which is super nice.
502.06	2.51	Um I'm gonna go to a concert in December.
504.94	1.69	I'm super excited for that.
510.04	3.46	Probably with my friends from UMD cause I haven't seen them in awhile
517.27	4.7	I also need to find a birthday present for my mom cause her birthday is like next month.
528.2	4.27	I guess cause it's her birthday I should go home, and visit her.
536.63	3.53	Uh shoot why is this so hard?
540.67	2.94	Umm it is kind of cold I guess outside now.
552.32	4.29	It's kind of funny to be here because I've never gotten like an fMRI before, but...
558.49	12.43	I guess, like, it reminds me, like, I always wanted to do this because, like, my cousin one time he told me about, like how he did a study at the NIH because one of his friends was like doing some research and they're like, oh, we need a participant to get scanned.
571.09	9.23	And then there's like, oh, like they said, my brain was like really even and then they're like are you also sick because like, they're like are you diagnosed with like anything and he was like no.
580.48	6.67	And they were like wow we're shocked because your brain is like super even and that's like kind of like a normal thing for them apparently I don't really know
587.97	3.15	Um, I have like three cousins.
