5.26	4.86	Okay... So, I, I guess I should start talking now.
11.14	6.91	Um, I don't know what I should, should be saying.
19.29	22.29	I think it's... This is kind of strange because usually I feel that whenever I'm asked to think about something, I would think and then my thoughts are never completely full and it starts to wander, but when you ask me to do it in a scanner, this becomes a... Think it's an issue.
46.0	7.81	Now all I'm thinking of is just like the cross on the screen and it's like a white cross and um, and nothing's changing.
54.03	20.36	I'm trying to remember not to move my head, trying to remember talking with my, just my chin, and now I'm wondering if that affects the way that I sound, the way that I pronounce certain words, and I can feel that I'm moving my ears, so maybe I am moving my head.
74.6	4.06	I don't know how that would actually affect the scan.
79.52	8.33	And every time I'm in a FIR machine, I remember the first time that I did a study and um, it was a very long study but then I was um...
88.25	7.46	Sure I was asleep for most of it and I always wondered if they could actually tell that I was not um, awake.
96.32	12.09	I thought I was doing their task but um, yeah, I always hope they just do not actually use that data because yeah, that's not a very good data but um...
109.73	14.46	Yeah, and I think it was like for a study with cartoons, study with videos or something, I don't remember what it is, but um, yeah, it's just a cartoon character,
124.2	7.2	so I'm thinking of the new shows that are on TV, especially um...
132.77	18.94	I think it's Hulu, Netflix, I don't know, one of those streaming platforms, they're doing a remake of the Scooby-Doo um, Show, but I am, I don't know, skeptical about how it is, how it would look.
151.91	12.79	I, I think um, it's a, it was a good show back then when I remember watching it as a kid, well, also maybe not as a kid, but I just remember watching it and it's a lot of spin-off.
165.11	11.88	And the funny thing about this show is that no matter how um, I remember it, going back to rewatch it, it's never really feels the same.
178.0	13.2	I know I used to just um, switch the TV on and watch whatever there is and it always seemed as though like this sort of show had like a, have like a long story arc that spans the whole season and stuff,
192.27	10.86	but uh, there's a few years ago I tried to go back and watch um, one of the shows again starting from just the first episode and watching it, and it really did not make any sense.
203.69	8.32	And I always wondered like just why it, why is it that I remember that there was actually like a cohesive plot?
212.67	19.9	I mean like something like SpongeBob where honestly it... They're just doing like single episode day-to-day stuff, I remember it such that oh, they are going on like this long adventure that just lasts forever and all that but, it's never really that case.
232.83	17.61	Um, yeah, so it's always um, disappointing to go back to look at something and realize that it's just not the way that uh, you remember it and um, yeah, that's, that's about how it is.
251.25	3.25	Um, um, I'm at the end of this thought.
257.35	10.4	Uh, I feel like when I heard about this, think a lot of part of this study, like my mind immediately goes into I should prepare something to say.
268.36	7.36	This is gonna be kind of um, awkward to just be lying here and not actually have anything to say.
275.93	5.02	And I really don't have much cohesive uh, train of thought.
281.92	14.26	And uh, another thing that is in my mind right now is that um, I was looking at this news article this morning um, about a school shooting, um, at I think the University of Virginia.
297.15	9.69	There was some, like, like some college, um, football player and yeah, it just seems like this kind of...
306.99	5.94	This is just happening more and more frequently nowadays and, and they...
314.2	13.66	Uh, it always makes me wonder like what exactly is the point of all these like stories in the media and the news if it's just gonna be like sick anecdotes and nothing's actually gonna change.
327.96	6.5	I feel like in the past... I don't know, maybe it's just one of those other things that like I'm just remembering, but like things have...
334.71	17.26	In the news, whenever they're big things, like they're really like once in a like blue moon kind of stuff, and it's always a big event and it's always lead to some kind of like realization or kind of like change in society.
352.07	5.94	But it seems nowadays like things are just repeating themselves, uh, over and over again.
358.77	22.14	It's like even with the whole um, Twitter kind of like debacles, just like with, oh yeah sure, Elon Musk is in the news again and look, another super rich guy um, doing like strange stuff and then, um, whether or not he is actually losing his fortune.
381.72	2.69	Oh, what? Like it's, it's happened before.
384.51	18.99	Just a few weeks ago it was Kanye and just a few weeks ago it was some other billionaire, it's just like everything has become like a tabloid, and everything has just become something that is um, of like on an endless cycle repeating itself and with no real point or resolution.
403.51	3.03	It's like it makes you wonder why people read the news anymore.
407.51	8.17	There's just... Like there's no real difference between even like actual current affairs and something like in entertainment.
416.49	4.93	Even the recent election, just kinda just like um, just like sports at this point.
421.43	3.74	Everyone's just cheering for a team that they are rooting for.
425.83	11.27	And like it's irrational in sports to just support a single team and basically anyone who's not your team are like opponents.
438.12	5.02	And it seems the same way in any kind of like regional or like government politics.
443.24	4.83	There's just... There's no nuance to it, there's no um, changing of your mind.
448.08	4.2	You just go in there and pick a side and stick to that side.
452.38	3.1	And that makes it kinda lose it novelties.
455.49	6.59	It's like sometimes if you don't look hard enough at what you are reading, you can't even tell what exactly it is.
463.4	9.49	It seems like um... Yeah, I don't know, like the media is um, not really doing its job.
473.6	6.24	Or if it's just... And there's just so many, um, different media outlets out there that everyone's just vying for attention.
480.96	20.66	Like there was an article that um, had a catchy title, I didn't read it, but it was from like 10 years ago maybe, uh, maybe even a load of talk about the attention economy and that the most valuable resource nowadays is not money or like the 15 minutes of fame but it's really just your attention.
502.59	3.45	Like that's the thing that everyone's trying to grab and it makes sense I think.
506.19	15.43	It's like it's just when you have so much more choices and so finite amount of like time, amount of like um, attention that you can give something that whatever it is, it's about um, whatever can grab your attention.
522.33	14.32	That's also kind of um, weird because um, you don't have that much time but at the same time you spend more and more time each day like just scrolling endlessly, like what?
537.21	7.82	Doomscrolling or death scrolling on just all these online um, sites of things.
545.79	3.45	Like if you don't have that much time, where do we get all the time to be doing this?
550.25	3.16	And it's just um, it's just crazy.
553.42	16.43	I wonder if like it's ever possible to just be more productive, to cut down on like this type of scrolling, this type of like doing aimless things um, endlessly and use this time to be more productive, be more proactive in different things.
570.05	16.91	I guess it's possible because since uh, people in the past have been doing it before the advent of all this internet uh, websites to just encourage people to um, stay on them for as long as um, you can.
588.23	28.93	Like, it seems like that the kind of like encouraging people to stay on it is kind of like manipulative, like um, people try to um, work out like what's the best kind of like design, best kinda of like, um... Like even they can... Like headlines of um, news articles and stuff, like you just got to use the same words...
