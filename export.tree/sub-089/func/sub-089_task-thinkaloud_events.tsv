9.9	3.72	I'm having trouble seeing the dark right now.
13.62	1.59	But I think I should be fine.
16.39	4.67	So, anyways, I'm feeling a little bit hungry.
22.92	7.53	I don't exactly know what I'm going to eat for lunch, but I'm thinking I may make a sandwich or two.
31.9	4.17	I'll see if I can put some turkey and bacon in there because I haven't had any in a while.
38.43	9.93	Either that or I may just pick up lunch from Subway, maybe, or from Chipotle.
48.36	6.94	I'm not too sure yet, but let's see.
55.3	2.51	What should I do afterwards?
59.87	2.78	Okay, I have a lot to do today.
65.37	6.48	I have a lot of writing to get done, so I should probably work on that.
73.08	4.17	And then I also need to finish my problem set as well.
79.02	13.65	I don't know how long that's going to take, so hopefully I can finish that quickly, and then I need to start reviewing for my exam on Thursday.
94.2	1.86	I don't know if I'm feeling ready yet.
98.01	5.7	I honestly probably should start preparing for that as soon as possible.
107.83	4.65	I also have some other classes to worry about.
113.43	7.03	I'll figure it out when it gets to that point, but let's see.
123.09	4.71	Okay, so I'm thinking about redecorating my room.
127.8	15.52	This is out of nowhere, but I'm getting a little bit tired of the design, the interior that I have right now because I've had it for a few years.
143.32	1.59	I'm thinking of changing it.
146.86	9.07	I don't know if I should go for a more blue or maybe mint-ish kind of colors, or maybe neutral.
159.59	10.3	I think neutral may be the most likely because it's a lot easier to find things that match the color tone or palette, whatever it's called.
170.71	11.34	But I definitely need to change my bedding because it's not thick enough for this weather right now.
182.05	1.31	It's a bit too cold.
186.72	3.67	Speaking of which, I should consider probably getting a heater.
190.87	4.02	I think that would help a lot because it's getting really cold.
195.77	6.68	I don't know, despite the three years I've been here, I still can't handle how cold it gets sometimes.
206.61	3.21	I also need to probably get more jackets.
209.82	11.24	Not more jackets, I think I have too many already, but probably switch out the ones I already have and get something that's warmer, better equipped for the season.
224.96	1.37	I really hope it snows more, by the way.
226.33	1.56	It was nice when it snowed outside.
228.73	1.72	It was snowing outside today.
230.45	1.01	I think it looked nice.
233.04	5.76	I don't know if it's going to be enough to play around in it or do anything like that.
238.8	4.08	I hope it will be, though, because I don't get to see snow a lot.
242.88	1.04	I think it'd be nice.
246.17	5.76	It hasn't snowed as much as it did two years ago, which is a bit unfortunate.
251.93	2.0	It looked really nice two years ago when it was snowing.
258.23	1.96	I was talking about interior design.
262.21	14.04	Okay, so after bedding, I think I may want to change the curtains for sure, because the curtains are nice, but I think I want them to match the new color that I'm going for.
277.73	12.11	And then I'll also probably need a new, either a new desk or find someone to help me fix the one that I have right now, because I can't get the drawer to fill all the way in properly.
290.75	15.51	I don't know if it was because of the way I put in the screws or whatever, but yeah, it was not close again properly and it kept breaking, so I'm going to switch that, especially if I want to fit more stuff in there.
310.07	2.26	I don't have to worry about the chair anymore, because I've gotten that covered.
313.21	7.92	It's okay, but I don't think it's going to last me very long, given the way it's been creaking a little bit here and there.
322.9	3.22	I don't know, I'll see how long it will last.
329.56	2.32	Let's see, what else did I want?
332.83	6.3	I think the mirror is fine, the bed frame is fine, fridge is fine.
344.84	7.81	I don't know, honestly I just wish, I think it'd be nice if the building had its own ceiling lights in it.
352.65	5.17	I still think it's a bit annoying that it doesn't, when it has one in the bathroom and in the kitchen.
358.76	2.04	They can put one in the bedroom either, but I don't know.
363.03	5.76	I don't know if it's just this one or all the apartments in Baltimore are like that, but I definitely...
370.37	0.56	I don't know.
372.97	5.75	Doesn't matter, I'm going to be stuck with it anyway for another year and a half, so I'm just going to deal with it.
378.72	4.62	It's not the worst of it, so I think it'll be fine.
383.34	11.07	I think by the time I graduate I should be able to find a job where I can earn enough money to move into a better or bigger apartment.
395.72	4.19	Hopefully, to get one by myself this time, because, I don't know.
402.15	8.92	As nice as it is having roommates, I think I'd be better off having my peace and quiet sometimes.
413.13	5.76	I don't know, a bit more introverted than I might have thought I was, probably.
419.65	21.16	I don't know if I'm more introverted or extroverted, even though I like going out and stuff, I still feel like when I come back home I want to be able to have some quiet, be able to focus on whatever, just take some time to myself.
441.39	4.67	But it's a lot more difficult when you're sharing a space with somebody.
450.14	4.99	We'll see, but I'll just try to make the most of what I have for now.
456.9	8.12	I'm going to try not to buy too many things, because moving it out is going to be a bit annoying.
465.02	7.91	I don't want to start dealing with putting things into a storage unit or flying everything all the way back to California.
474.27	5.2	I may end up selling whatever I don't need again, like my old desk and chair.
481.07	5.56	Or I could probably just leave behind some furniture for another residence, probably.
493.91	6.58	Okay, yeah, I definitely don't want to deal with the storage unit again.
506.75	2.75	I should have gone to bed a little earlier.
511.23	5.21	I don't know why I kept staying up, even though I didn't have much to do.
517.03	4.81	Maybe not staring at the screen so much would definitely help.
522.66	1.59	Maybe my eyesight wouldn't be so bad.
532.39	1.22	I'm getting hungry again.
536.45	2.72	I've got to stop thinking about what to eat, because it's just going to make it worse.
548.27	15.26	Okay, I'm suddenly thinking about what I'm going to do over the summer, because I'm still not sure if my cousins are going to be coming over for summer.
565.65	4.83	It would be nice to have them come visit.
571.12	4.68	We could probably go visit Universal at Disneyland.
576.88	1.22	Because I haven't seen them in a long time.
578.1	6.81	I think it would be nice to see them again, especially my cousin's new daughter.
585.82	3.99	I don't know if she's five or six, or maybe four.
591.39	1.14	Actually, what year was she born?
592.53	3.9	Was it 2004?
596.43	4.9	No, it was definitely after 2017.
