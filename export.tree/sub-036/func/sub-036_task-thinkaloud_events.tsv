84.13	2.7	Uh, finishing some of the tasks.
90.19	2.34	I hope I have some time in the evening to go to climbing gym.
94.03	10.61	Mm, since I looked at all of the cooking recipes, I was supposed to make some food for the next days, and I guess I could actually try the quinoa recipe.
104.65	3.1	I just have to go and buy some of the stuff, uh, it looked really good.
109.73	5.22	Uh, I don't know, if it's nice outside, maybe I can take a walk.
117.53	22.78	Mm, I think I... The... I remembered that I need a tube, it's... Keeps come... It's a... This idea keeps coming back to me, and each time it's like a small spike of anxiety comes back, kind of sweating, kind of activation of autonomous function.
148.04	9.48	Uh, haven't really had anything for lunch either, I should go get some food.
158.23	1.08	Maybe go to the deli.
160.81	1.98	Uh, get a bagel with eggs or something like that.
170.05	10.19	Mm, just, uh, yeah, remembered the... Since I was thinking about cooking, uh, yesterday, met with some friends.
181.5	6.23	Uh, and we made, uh, empanadas, which is a, kind of a typical South American food.
188.99	2.28	It was a lot of fun, and the food was really delicious.
193.07	4.97	Uh, but also reminded me of home-cooked food.
199.12	12.29	And um, in about a month when the semester ends, I'm gonna go back home and I'm really looking forward to seeing my mom and having some home-cooked food.
213.09	29.74	Uh, which kind of again, just reminds me of home and, um, just remembered of how the place where I grew up used to look like and um, where I used to go as a kid, a village uh, close to where I used to live where all of my cousins used to have fun when we're real, really young.
244.09	8.87	Uh, it used to build up of uh... There was a small river going by, it used to build up of rocks.
253.62	4.08	Make kind of a gate so that the level of the water would rise.
258.11	2.28	Uh, we could take a bath.
262.07	6.6	Uh, and even though it was a river coming from the land, that was so cold, since we were kids, we just didn't care at all.
270.23	13.96	Uh, yeah, and also thinking of spending some time with uh, friends that I met in school.
285.03	21.47	Uh, and just in general remembering, uh, friends and memories that we had together, and I guess it's... And a very, very dear place to go back.
308.41	15.17	Uh, and from traveling, I remember that at beginning of December um, I have to go up, uh, to a workshop at Brown, uh, where I used to work before,
323.59	14.68	and I also I have some friends there and some friends from other places are gonna come and it's gonna be a great just combination of working and seeing, uh, people that I know for a while and are dear to me.
340.49	23.68	And from traveling to another university, I remember that I have uh, my class on Wednesday at University of Maryland, where we go each week and, uh, we have a lot of reading each week to do, and I haven't done any of it and I have to finish it by Wednesday noon, so that's kind of a stressful thought at the back of my head.
366.03	4.5	Uh, and other stuff that I have to finish.
372.86	4.02	And since I remembered us doing a lot of work, I just remembered that a coffee would be good.
377.84	9.05	And we have a, we have an espresso machine in the lab, so looking forward to having one of those when I get back.
388.99	14.75	Uh, and if I just remembered, that, uh, only other person that's in the office, that's uh, Jihan, so probably gonna sit down and talk to her for like 10 or 15 minutes.
404.7	2.05	That's always an enjoyable part of the day.
407.2	4.45	Uh, and then I remembered the Baby Lab.
413.85	19.5	Uh, that's just right across the hall, and we're supposed to start running an experiment with kids, and uh, I set up everything in the room, but I have to kind of learn the script, and talk to the RAs to see when we could schedule participants the soonest.
435.3	13.55	Uh, yeah, I don't know. I guess I have too many thoughts about work, maybe I should focus a little bit more on the weekend as well.
449.8	5.44	Uh, speaking of that, I should make some plans for the upcoming weekend.
455.64	4.75	I don't know what I should do. If it's a nice weather, maybe I could go out hiking somewhere.
462.39	6.4	It's like I think I stay too much in the building in Ames and just don't go outside in nature enough.
469.49	13.2	It's probably not healthy, so... Uh, some friends just got a car, so it's easy to go anywhere close by, so maybe we could go to a forest or something like that.
484.34	6.7	Uh, speaking of that, uh, I remembered I wanted to do some traveling in the summer.
492.49	4.0	Mm, I haven't really been in this part of the world before.
498.24	10.45	And when I'll take some time off, I was thinking of going to Central America or something like that and since we were looking before at all kinds of websites where you search places
508.7	11.18	that's... I guess I'll have to take some time to plan the trip, find a place to stay and look for a plane ticket and, and places to visit and stuff like that.
522.38	0.8	That, that should be fun.
524.63	25.2	Uh, maybe even go somewhere that's just sunny and, and take a bath and stuff like that, which is kind of like a conflict between doing that and obviously joining my time on this continent,
549.98	16.14	but also, there's only that much free time that you have, I could also go back home next summer, uh, see my family and, oh, especially my mom. I think there's...
567.12	25.15	She's, uh, getting old and maybe there are, there are not an infinite amount of occasions left to go and see her, so I, I guess I should, um, balance exploring but also uh, responsibilities that you have.
595.57	10.95	Which going home reminds me that it's winter is coming, although it doesn't seem like here at all and I haven't really brought any warm clothes, so I should look at the weather forecast if...
