onset	duration	transcript
25.96	8.24	I just finished my, uh, business plan for my final, um, for entrepreneurship last night, so that felt really nice
35.84	1.48	I was really excited to get that done
37.66	2.73	It’s so much work, so much research
41.19	2.02	I’m not good at writing anyways
47.49	1.97	I’ve never been in an MRI before
49.5	3.96	This feels really…this feels really funny
55.13	3.62	Kind of reminds me of, um, House MD
59.61	3.25	It’s a show, sometimes watch it on YouTube, it’s really funny
64.59	1.51	The doctor has really good humor
66.92	6.61	He’s very dry, very dry sarcastic humor, but I really enjoy that
75.99	1.59	There are such, such good episodes
78.73	4.15	They’re, like, always the same format basically, but it’s always very original
91.73	11.93	I’ve never actually seen one of these… I’ve heard of like these, uh, forty-five degree glasses that have like a mirror, so you can read while lying down or something
104.41	3.26	I’ve never actually seen something like this, so this… it’s kind of cool
111.3	2.08	Feel like that would be really cool to have
114.48	1.43	That could be a good Christmas gift
118.28	4.76	Speaking of Christmas gifts, I still need to figure out what to get someone
124.69	5.07	I don’t really… I- I have to get a gift for someone but I don’t really know her that well
131.2	5.89	And… I don’t even know what to get
138.95	6.22	Huh… I need to make up my mind soon, otherwise it won’t arrive before Christmas
146.63	3.07	Another gift I got was a, um, a cocktail smoker
150.68	7.82	But it didn’t come with all the stuff in the box, so I have to like, go figure that out, go talk to them or talk to the company
160.66	2.46	Try to get that fixed
171.89	8.38	That… felt really nice to get that, uh, my business plan done yesterday
181.03	5.04	It was so much work, so much research, so much writing but at least it’s done
187.44	17.96	And I really want to go into, like, some sort of startups, um, possibly on the same topic so maybe I’ll… I think this will, like, having written this paper in, in two days will have, will have helped me, uh, prepare
206.29	1.01	It’s good experience
209.78	5.89	Working on a startup right now or like, in the early pha- phases, with my suitemates right now
218.88	3.98	And… I don’t know, honestly it might fail
222.89	1.56	I think it, it probably will fail
224.51	6.76	There’s like a eighty-five percent chance that it will fail, but I think that would be valuable experience
232.14	3.41	And then hopefully I’ll make another startup and that will actually be successful
237.76	12.2	I feel like with, with the rate that startups fail, I’ll fa- I’ll probably have to work on a couple before I have any actual, like actually hit the jackpot
259.62	23.49	It feels so weird, I really want to… I want to just go with the normal safe job in the CS industry since I’m, I’m a CS major and I enjoy computer science, but I also really, I really want to work on a startup
283.75	1.47	I feel like that would be pretty awesome
286.57	4.93	It’s very ambitious but, and very risky but I think it would be really fun
294.4	6.46	It’s like one of my, I feel like entrepreneurship is my main passion, and then CS is like a secondary one
301.66	1.86	Which is odd ‘cause it used to be sorta the other way
305.15	3.99	But now it’s… now, entrepreneurship is the one that’s leading
310.59	4.38	Even though it’s a riskier one and I shouldn’t really do risky
317.78	1.8	Maybe I could just do both, I don’t know
332.85	1.35	I’m hoping to lift tonight
334.27	8.65	I’ve been… I’ve been just grinding for finals the past few days and, it’s been so much work in the library so,
344.27	3.39	hopefully I’ll be able to lift tonight or something, or maybe tomorrow night
350.08	1.57	It’s just, it’s been a while
355.85	7.8	Oh yeah, I have to… I have to text Lucas and, and drag him back into going to the… to the gym with me
364.76	1.46	I don’t think he’s been going much
367.66	1.36	I need to drag him back in there
369.79	1.95	Same with uh, Christian and John
373.79	2.27	I feel like I’m a personal trainer, like a free personal trainer
377.99	4.53	I’ve worked with, like, I’ve gone to the gym with like seven different people
386.39	1.22	A lot of new people too
388.28	1.64	Like, dragging a bunch of new people in
390.99	15.46	That reminds me of my, um, there’s a personal trainer, at Gold’s Gym over somewhere, and he showed me, like, we did a fitness testing and he corrected my form but then that ended up hurting my wrist, so that was dumb
407.82	3.58	I was annoyed about that ‘cause I, that, that messed up for a while
415.18	1.73	Personal trainers are kind of overrated
420.0	4.26	There’s a lot on, like on social media that just do stupid sh- stuff
430.09	5.16	Uh, I’m also hoping to, I kinda want to play some Valorant tonight with John and Christian
435.47	8.93	I haven’t, I’ve been too busy studying and writing papers to really do anything fun
445.59	1.92	So hopefully I can play some games tonight
451.47	10.13	Oh yeah and then, I also want to hm, I want to spend more time with Coco in the next few days
462.55	12.06	I’ve been away from home for a while, like each day studying in the library so, feel like he’s just been alone in my room so, hopefully I can go cuddle with him and pet him
478.48	1.55	I gotta get some more greens for him
482.28	7.25	I feel like, what have I gotten? Mustard… mustard greens, mint, parsley, lettuce
491.34	2.66	I think I should get some kale or something, I’m not sure
495.96	5.37	It’s kind of weird having a, having a pet, cause I’ve never had one before
503.87	4.03	I feel… I feel like a parent
516.52	3.5	Such a crazy change, like, I didn’t, I never had a pet before
521.37	5.2	Not even, not even a family pet, and now I have my own pet and he’s all my responsibility
527.58	0.82	That’s crazy
531.48	2.74	That is really crazy for me
537.23	1.81	He’s a lot of work, but he’s very worth it
553.05	10.97	Oh yeah, there were some other people who wanted to visit, and I kinda… I need to text them and figure that out, figure out when I’m going to, uh, let them come visit him
567.69	6.72	It’s so weird trying to schedule things right now, ‘cause it’s finals and people are busy but in different ways
574.69	9.32	Like I’m… I got done early but some people have all their stuff next week and… I don’t know if people are gonna be down to hang out this weekend
585.74	1.26	It’s very odd
593.69	6.35	Oh, I need to… I need to text Andrew uh…
