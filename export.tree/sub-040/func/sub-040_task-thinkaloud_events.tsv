1.48	15.17	It's kind of weird how it's just like the words are written backwards because I feel like it should be okay to just somehow invert them, so that, that they're the right way round in the mirror, 'cause it's actually really funny to read.
16.74	11.25	Also, I just realized that like the two fuzzy things on the side of the thingy, one of them is black and one of them is white which I did not realize, which is kind of cool.
28.48	12.87	It remind me of like, you know, when you're doing like laundry and you have to go in the dryer and like one of the little fuzz... Or like a random like coarse brush or something.
44.39	1.03	This whole setup is kind of weird.
45.76	11.74	It took me forever to like realize that the thing was just like behind me and it wasn't like somehow approaching from the ceiling so that's cool.
58.24	3.36	Also there's these random purple things on the mirror.
62.32	2.55	I don't really know how they got there.
65.68	4.28	It's almost like somebody did some spray-painting near the mirror.
71.03	1.38	At least I think they're purple.
72.51	1.47	They look kind of purple-ish.
76.05	1.55	I have purple nail polish.
78.17	10.6	I was considering like painting my nails the other day but I really wanted to do like false nails but I don't have any glue 'cause the glue I had got dried up.
89.7	12.82	Also, I shouldn't do false nails if I wanna do climbing because that makes it really hard to like do crimps and stuff and it's also really easy for the nails to come off.
102.84	4.88	So that has happened before and it hurts, so that's not fun.
110.35	2.1	Um, I see the red tape.
112.53	0.77	That's cool.
114.24	5.05	I keep thinking of like the little like round bulbs on the side.
119.78	9.46	They remind me of either like Wall-E or like, um, you know, just random security camera.
129.27	7.02	I feel like this could easily be a scene in like a spy movie or a space movie for that matter.
137.25	9.55	But yeah, like for the... One of the classes I wanted to take, it was US colonialism and science fiction and I'm actually really into science fiction.
147.61	4.45	Um, and in it we get to watch a bunch of movies.
152.78	1.36	Not a bunch but like two.
156.02	12.87	And one of them is like Avatar, so I'm kind of thinking it would be a good idea to have a viewing party to watch the first Avatar movie before the second Avatar movie comes out again.
169.54	4.37	Cause I'm actually really looking forward to that and hopefully I can like get a group of people together.
174.56	4.66	Like the thing that I'm wondering is like what took them so long to make the second Avatar movie?
179.79	18.37	Cause like I saw the trailer and maybe it's just me but like the animation, I'm not sure like how much it's progressed but maybe I'll pay more attention to that if I watch the first movie again 'cause I knew that was pretty revolutionary in terms of like, um, animation stuff.
198.82	7.33	Like I really wish I could get into animation more 'cause I used to do like stop-motion when I was younger with like my American girl dolls.
206.89	8.8	And I would like go out and like dress them up all pretty, spend... Like stealing a couple of my parents things to use as props and stuff.
216.24	0.63	That was fun.
216.92	1.36	I used to be a lot more creative.
218.54	2.61	It would have been fun to like do animation and get back into it.
221.83	8.93	Especially like if you could do like puppets or like clay puppets because I also used to really like making things out of polymer clay.
231.1	8.9	And like movies like Coraline and, uh, The Boxtrolls, and I think there was like Kobe and the Bee Strings or something.
240.68	9.8	All of those movies I think are really, really, really cool to watch like the artistry but also I don't think I would ever have the patience to like spend years making a movie.
250.57	8.82	But it would be so cool to be able to like make the sets and make all the different sorts of dolls and things for that, so that would be really cool.
259.94	7.53	Like sometimes I think like maybe I'll like eventually spend the time on doing and finding courses to do that.
267.58	7.18	I mean, there's YouTube but like that's not as fun or like as hands-on because then it's a lot of like being self-taught and I should never good at that.
275.23	10.23	Also like when you're old you can still do stop-motion and animation and you can make crafts so like you could be retired and then like make your hobby your main job as an old person.
286.16	0.71	That would be cool.
287.18	3.04	I have a lot of aspirations for what I wanna do as an old person.
290.87	13.38	Like I wanna be one of those fit grandmas who like walks past you on the hiking trails or is like really into yoga or also like makes the best cookies.
304.4	14.08	But like most importantly I decided that I will become, [chuckle], I would get into good shape as a grandma so I can ski past people in cross country skiing and like go down hills really fast.
319.77	6.44	So we have the time to progress and become the ultimate old person, the superior old person.
327.38	10.48	I don't know where I'd want to live though because I feel like when I think of skiing I think of Norway but that's also on the condition that there still is snow because who knows how that's gonna go.
337.89	11.97	Cause it's actually been pretty sad because I remember when I used to visit when I was younger we would have like solid snow for a while but the last three years it's been like uncertain as to whether or not we'll have a white Christmas or not.
350.6	7.08	And also like it melts so quickly you get like a couple of inches of snow and then it melts and then everything's just super icy again.
358.38	4.04	So that's kinda sad 'cause I remember that it used to stick a lot more.
362.44	3.12	So I'm definitely noticing the differences there a lot.
365.63	14.47	And also like with the weather here, the fact that like it's been sometimes like 18 degrees, sometimes even 20, like last week even and it's like in the middle of November, that's kind of crazy.
381.75	9.86	But also like the time difference now and like the further we set the clocks back the extra hours for your night because I've been able to like wake up kind of early again which I like.
392.24	12.86	They weren't the best in the mornings, but like in the evenings it's like a double-edged sword because like now I have more time in the mornings to work, which is when I do my best work because my brain isn't dead yet.
405.68	9.16	But like the fact that it gets dark so quickly means I have to lose like all evening productivity because I just want to sleep, especially with the lighting.
415.51	5.92	Like the lighting is either too harsh or it's like yellowy, kind of soft, so then I just want to like curl up.
421.53	4.39	"And also because like break feels imminent, I'm like, ""Oh, I'm so close to being done."
426.6	1.51	"I can just take it easy."""
429.63	7.27	I have an essay to write today and like I've had like three essays to write and actually I have one more to write after this that I kind of forgot about.
436.98	4.11	But it's not like an actual essay, it's like an outline of a philosophy paper.
441.17	4.79	The only problem is that I have not been keeping up to date with any more of these philosophy papers.
446.63	7.65	I've also been missing some of my philosophy lectures to write these papers, so I've fallen a bit behind that but it's okay.
454.86	7.25	I'll find an interesting like topic to read up on and also like I can just like go over the lecture notes and discussion questions.
462.72	8.9	I might actually talk about delusions because, um, I forgot her name like Hannah Pickett, I think he is... She's the wife of like our actual professor.
472.0	1.81	She came in and talked a bit about that.
474.18	12.69	But those papers aren't actual papers, they're kind of just like case studies and I'm not sure how you would like outline a case, like various case studies, but I'll just summarize and group each case study.
487.45	3.16	But that wouldn't go within the two-word, word limit.
491.06	4.08	But, yeah, either way, so I have to write my English paper today.
495.53	8.63	And it's quite funny 'cause this was the one I was actually looking forward to writing because the last English paper I had was just like, oh, The Wife of Bath, it was complicated.
504.74	2.66	I did not like the Canterbury Tales.
508.25	1.05	Is it Geoffrey Chaucer?
509.36	3.24	I keep wanting to call him Edward Chaucer but it's Geoffrey Chaucer.
513.38	1.38	Geoffrey is an interesting name.
515.0	12.76	Sometimes I'm like, I think it starts with a J or a G, like I know some people and they're called George but they spell their name with a J and that's confusing sometimes.
527.82	11.84	Spelling is just hard in general especially like when I'm typing because sometimes, you know, you type and like one finger goes for the other and then it's because of the way you read, like you don't like read it letter by letter.
539.85	4.11	Once you know words you kind of just like get the general gist of it.
544.03	3.45	So I'll be like looking at a letter that has a red squiggly line under it.
547.6	4.23	This is because I've been writing so many essays and then I'm just like I don't see what's wrong.
551.94	0.74	Am I stupid?
554.13	13.31	But no it's just that I have either added one letter too many or like it's in the wrong place, like I have an I after an L instead of before it.
568.18	8.98	So then I'm just staring back and forth between the corrected version and the incorrect version, like they're the exact same, that meme is like, what's the difference?
577.53	1.68	There is none, but there is.
579.75	16.01	So that's why we love autocorrect unless we're texting, then autocorrect can be a bit of a mess, because, yes, my spelling is important especially when I'm like rushing to do the texting, but also sometimes it just changes what I wanted to say.
596.25	15.45	Another worst thing, this isn't really like it messes things up but it ruins the vibe if you like add... When you write on my way like OMW and it change it to on my way with an exclamation mark.
