2.09	7.02	Umm, well this is a crazy experience, umm, and I'm so glad that, uh, uh, I'm getting to be a part of it.
10.58	6.6	Umm, from the outside, uh, it, it, it never seemed this, umm, complex.
17.67	11.19	Umm, and I'm glad that I'm getting to experience it because I'll start scanning participants soon and, uh, it's nice to get a perspective from the other side.
29.09	15.69	Uh, umm, as soon as I, uh, I went into the scanner, it, it just transported me back to, umm, to being, uh, on a train in, uh, on the upper berth in India.
45.22	3.76	I, I dunno why, uh, but it reminds me a lot of that.
49.45	8.47	Umm, umm, I wonder what my parents are doing right now.
58.53	5.81	Umm, it's nighttime in India, so, uh, probably getting ready to sleep.
67.28	2.86	I'm also a bit hungry right now and, umm,
71.65	6.62	after going back, would probably eat something, maybe stir fried noodles.
79.21	3.5	Umm, I'm also missing my cat a lot.
82.96	1.9	Uh, her name is Persley and,
86.58	6.59	I would like to go back and watch birds with her, umm, outside the window.
95.08	23.67	Oh, this reminds me I also have to read a research paper for tomorrow's lab meeting, umm, which I'm really excited about because it's about, umm, how language might have evolved in humans and umm, it is something that I have been thinking for quite some time.
119.96	17.86	Uh, this reminds me, umm, winter has come... Uh, I mean, uh, semester is about to end and I am looking forward to next year, umm, because of several reasons.
139.64	1.63	One of them is ice skating.
142.46	12.26	Umm, uh, last year I, I skated for the first time and, uh, it was such an incredible experience and I, I loved it.
156.3	14.22	Umm, and oh yeah, I'll be ice skating this weekend as well because, uh, I will be going to an ASL meet up, uh, where we'll be ice skating.
171.48	13.11	Umm, ASL is such a great language and, uh, I'm having a really fun time learning it, umm, umm.
186.13	10.93	Oh wow, I think, uh, my nerves have calmed down a bit, umm, since the scan began and I'm feeling much better now.
198.06	2.5	Umm, my lips are a bit dry.
204.46	5.23	Umm, I would like to start reading some novels.
209.99	28.62	Uh, I was read... I was, uh, watching a video, YouTube recommendation video last night, which was about, umm, a book with a girl, uh, joins a cult, umm, which seemed interesting just to, umm, just to get some perspective on what could drive a person to, umm, to join a cult.
240.64	5.76	Umm, well it feels like, uh, the scanner is moving, uh, like a train.
247.31	18.18	Umm, ah, I will start, also start behavioral experiments from next week and have to recruit participants with that, umm, I'm excited to be getting to, umm, conduct behavioral experiments for the first time.
265.94	0.96	Uh, it will be fun.
268.37	14.14	Umm, I'll also go to DC next week, uh, by train, umm, uh, for ASL trivia, which I think would be quite fun.
283.49	9.45	Umm, uh, right now [chuckle] I'm thinking of a GIF that, uh, my friend sent me just before the scan.
293.67	6.02	Umm, it was about someone going inside the FMRI scanner, uh, and was quite funny.
305.53	4.83	Umm, oh, what should I watch on Netflix next?
313.46	6.37	Uh, I think there is some new movie, uh, which would, which was out this Thursday.
320.39	14.9	It was the Elephant Whisperers, about two people in Southern India who adopt an elephant and they live together as a family in sync with the nature.
336.85	11.2	Umm, this reminds me of our practice session just before the scan and, uh, one category was learning about birds and umm...
349.43	1.65	I really like birdwatching,
354.06	12.74	uh, I used to go out quite often doing birdwatching in India, and I think I need to start doing it here, umm, other than from the bedroom window. [chuckle]
367.31	12.3	Umm, This morning, uh... Actually for the past two weeks, I have been seeing a black stray cat around my apartment.
380.01	23.71	And this morning I saw my cat running from one room to the other, looking outside the window, and I saw that the black cat is roaming outside and this was around 5:00 AM in the morning and I went out, uh, with some wet cat food and put it in front of the window.
404.52	4.9	Uh, but the cat, uh, is very shy and it ran away from me.
410.23	20.52	Umm, I'm hoping to, uh, get it familiar with me and maybe in few days or weeks, umm, I could, uh, maybe take it to the doctor or adopt it or maybe take it to some shelter.
431.55	2.52	Umm, let's see what happens.
435.42	12.93	Umm, I'm also looking forward to going to State College, umm, in Pennsylvania in the end of December.
449.21	4.6	Umm, maybe I try skiing for the first time.
454.84	8.01	Umm, I also plan to do a lot of cooking in the holidays, cooking a lot of Indian dishes.
463.83	9.33	Umm, I need to start meal prepping I guess, umm, for next semester.
473.4	6.86	I, I need to start me preparing to get, uh, just to get a better routine going next semester.
481.15	3.92	Umm, yeah, get better with time management.
487.19	3.39	Mm, umm, would be nice.
490.83	6.79	Oh, yesterday I got my new jacket, umm, which I had ordered some days ago.
498.42	20.52	Umm, yeah, my parents have been, uh, have been quite insistent about me buying a good jacket because the ones from India were not really enough for the cold here, and, umm, yeah, maybe I can use that for skiing also.
520.8	12.61	Umm, I would like to get back to spending a lot of time doing sports because it makes me happy and I have not been doing that enough.
534.34	1.94	Uh, I mean, even barely.
537.47	7.33	I, I love table tennis, umm, but haven't really got the chance to play it here.
545.85	14.96	Umm, umm, this reminds me of, umm, some tournaments that I have been part of back in home and umm, yeah.
562.26	9.29	Umm, I have three papers due next week, which are going to take a lot of time this weekend.
572.48	7.03	Umm, hopefully, umm, I'll be going to get them done.
580.77	16.87	Umm, right now wondering, umm, how I have lost track of time here inside the scanner and I have no idea how much time has gone, has passed and how much is remaining.
598.6	10.62	Umm, umm, I'm thinking about my lab and uh, the dinner, which we went to a few days ago.
