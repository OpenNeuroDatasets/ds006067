3.43	8.47	So the biggest thing on my mind right now is that I just found out that I’m going to be traveling in three weeks for work.
12.34	2.32	And I found out that I’m actually going to Ecuador.
15.42	5.49	And I’m feeling kind of anxious about it because I feel like I don’t have a lot of time to plan for that trip.
21.56	6.3	And I was already planning on going to India for work as well, but that one wasn’t until January.
28.06	2.04	So I feel like I had more time to plan that one.
30.3	6.04	But um finding out that my trip to Ecuador is gonna happen in about three and a half is a little.
36.93	3.99	a little nervewracking ‘cause I don’t have any flights or anything set up yet so.
41.64	2.52	Um, I’m feeling a little anxious about that today.
44.47	5.87	But I’m also really excited that it’s Friday because I only have to work a half day on Fridays.
51.06	5.8	And I’m done with work at noon so now I can actually go and enjoy um the weekend.
57.51	9.75	And this weekend, actually tonight I have plans to visit my boyfriend, it’s his birthday so we’re gonna have a party at his house and play board games.
67.41	8.79	And just kind of have like a good night of Thai food and um some of his friends are coming by so I’m pretty excited for that as well.
76.84	2.86	Um I also thought it was really cold today for some reason.
79.91	4.78	It was pretty chilly and crisp out and I wasn’t kind of expecting that.
84.69	1.88	And I went outside for the first time today.
87.49	1.64	And I was really cold.
90.25	3.75	Also my arm is a little sore because I just got my flu shot
94.48	5.47	So I had to walk all the way to the um medical campus and get my flu vaccine.
99.96	2.21	And so my arm hurts a little bit from that shot.
103.23	3.69	But otherwise I kind of feel like I’m forgetting something at work.
107.29	10.31	I always get that feeling on Fridays when I am forgetting a task or I didn’t complete everything and so my mind is also thinking about all the emails that came in today.
118.11	6.08	And if there’s anything that I had to um do that that was time sensitive.
124.19	1.59	And I don’t think there is but.
126.34	1.61	If not I guess I’ll just um.
128.83	3.54	Wait until Monday to address those things but.
133.1	2.68	Um I was also really happy today.
135.8	3.35	I got a lot of chores around the house done today because I worked from home.
139.66	5.53	And so I was pretty excited that I was able to um get a lot of stuff done.
145.5	7.43	And um kind of get some get some things done that I don’t have to worry about over the weekend.
155.16	2.29	Yeah but that’s kind of where my mind is.
157.45	7.43	I’m also just thinking about how I hope this weather holds out so I can go hiking a few more times here in November before it gets too cold.
165.82	5.94	Um because I really want be able to go hiking before the snow and the really really cold weather comes.
173.16	3.06	And I’m happy now that the leaves are finally changing.
176.26	7.48	I feel like the last time I went hiking I thought the leaves were gonna change but instead they were uh pretty green yet so.
184.82	3.49	I’m hoping that I can get out and go hiking somewhere around Maryland and.
189.25	2.68	Actually see some color this time of year.
193.97	3.17	Yeah I’m also, I think I’m thinking a lot today about my family.
197.21	3.08	Uh my grandma just uh like got covid so.
201.02	6.68	Uh, she’s fine she has just mild symptoms but I’m just yeah thinking of her and the family and what um.
208.64	4.66	Hopefully she’ll be able to get someone to bring her her groceries and she’ll be able to quarantine but.
213.93	5.18	I talked to her this morning and I know she’s disappointed because the family was going to come up there this weekend.
219.44	2.0	Uh. They all live in Wisconsin, so.
222.53	3.79	Yeah I think, I I hope she’s feeling better.
226.32	3.81	She said she just has a cough but, I hope she’s feeling alright but.
231.07	3.3	Yeah I I do miss my family I’m excited to see them.
234.61	7.2	I’m going home for the holidays in December so I’m excited to fly back to Wisconsin but.
242.25	1.9	Wondering if I need to get a booster shot.
244.2	4.81	I kinda hope that I’m able, or that we’re all able to get a booster shot before I fly home.
250.57	2.57	I feel like that’s gonna be needed before I get on a plane.
254.12	4.34	But yeah otherwise I’m really happy it’s the weekend
258.71	1.64	I’m feeling kind of tired
260.96	8.4	so I’m ready to just unwind and relax and get outside maybe a little bit today but yeah.
269.51	1.1	I’m I’m happy.
270.61	1.74	Oh I also have to fix my car tomorrow.
274.23	3.43	Um my car is broken a little bit so I do have to go fix it.
283.85	6.43	I’m really happy that I just like I’m a recent graduate so I’m also really happy that I don’t have any school work this weekend
291.31	4.65	so I’m really excited that I can just like actually have a weekend off.
296.0	6.27	And I can um you know just focus on hanging out with my friends and seeing everyone.
302.33	2.18	I’m meeting with a friend too on Sunday.
305.1	2.28	Her and I are going out for brunch so
307.58	4.17	I’m really excited to see her ‘cause I haven’t seen her in a while and she recently got engaged.
312.27	3.22	So I’m pretty happy to go see her for breakfast on Sunday.
316.64	2.54	Um also I can’t believe it’s November already.
319.66	3.06	I was thinking about that today we’re done with the first week of November.
323.35	3.29	And it’s already the holiday season and the holiday month.
326.64	4.31	And I can’t believe that we’re already at the end of 2021 so.
331.74	2.15	I hope 2022 is better than 2021.
333.96	2.29	2021 kinda wasn’t great
336.26	2.8	I feel like we were still on lockdown a little bit with covid.
341.57	9.73	I also saw today that Pfizer approved an antiviral pill for covid so I’m pretty curious to see if that will work or what that’s about.
351.31	2.55	and I was reading that article before I came here.
354.43	8.77	Um it just seems like a really interesting thing to be able to have a pill that people can take that makes covid symptoms less severe.
365.52	2.29	Yeah I saw that in the I think it was in the New York Times.
367.88	6.7	But I was pretty pretty curious about that um and what that looks like.
375.91	4.83	Yeah I talked to my mom today too and she said that my little cousins are gonna get the covid vaccine so.
381.64	5.57	I know they’re pretty excited to finally not have to worry about that in their schools um.
387.83	1.73	Because their schools are fully in person.
392.84	4.11	But I’m not sure I gotta think about what else comes.
399.74	0.91	I miss my sister.
400.65	0.99	I almost saw her.
402.22	3.12	She um, oh no, I haven’t I didn’t almost see her.
405.53	1.33	I talked to her the other day
407.14	1.42	she also lives in Wisconsin.
408.56	6.16	And just got to be a she just got a new job as a labor delivery nurse and so I was talking to her about that.
415.37	6.08	And um about seeing her when I go home in December.
421.45	5.41	So I’m excited for her to be able to you know, reunite and see her and.
427.25	1.66	Um see how everyone’s doing.
429.4	1.11	I wonder how my brother’s doing.
431.02	1.44	I haven’t talked to him in a little bit.
432.48	1.6	I feel like I should probably call him.
434.34	5.54	He’s in college so I feel like he just doesn’t have time to talk a lot.
440.74	2.31	But also I hope his classes are going well.
443.16	1.77	I’m sure he’s pretty busy with all of that.
448.11	6.02	Yeah I also, today um my cat was being really difficult when I was working.
454.67	1.63	She kept climbing up on the desk and
456.57	2.14	like sitting on my keyboard and so
459.58	1.67	that was a bit challenging today.
461.44	1.56	But I don’t mind
463.32	4.51	I only work from home twice a week so she bothers me twice a week that’s not a big deal but
468.27	3.35	also it was a half day so I didn’t really have to worry about that too much.
475.69	2.72	Um this is also my third time here.
478.45	5.27	I’ve been I’ve done two other studies here at this Kennedy Krieger institute so
484.73	10.32	it was I felt a little more comfortable coming back ‘cause I kind of knew where everything was and about the check in process and I feel a little bit anxious sometimes when I do those things so.
495.67	3.7	happy that I could come back and um do another study.
499.47	1.89	I always think these studies are really interesting
508.33	4.39	I can’t believe that last week the the down by the harbor flooded.
512.74	7.53	I live in the Fells Point area and I remember what was it last Friday that all of the w- like the streets were under water.
520.9	4.47	Ooh I was so worried that um my apartment was going to flood.
525.66	2.63	But everything was ok so I’m happy about that.
528.33	4.23	I know that they were giving out sandbags for the apartment buildings and the houses so.
533.2	2.9	I’m glad that they were able to you know.
536.54	3.09	Kind of prepare us for that big rainstorm we got.
539.68	2.14	But yeah I’m not used to that.
541.86	0.94	I’m used to the cold.
543.26	4.16	I’m from Wisconsin so these rainstorms are always pretty interesting for me.
549.71	5.68	I’m also thinking about like my trip to Ecuador that’s coming up that I have to do in about three weeks.
555.91	4.2	I’m thinking about that because I was going to go to a concert at the beginning of December.
560.11	2.44	And I’m realizing now that I have to cancel that.
563.29	2.77	And I hope I don’t have any other plans.
567.86	4.2	Did I have any other concrete plans for the beginning of December?
572.14	0.77	I don’t think so.
573.23	2.54	I think the concert was the only thing I had to do.
578.54	1.58	I have to let my friend know that.
581.51	3.31	I have to, I can’t go to that.
584.93	2.03	Hopefully she can find someone to go with her.
588.53	1.11	I feel bad but.
590.33	6.69	I’m glad that I’m able to at least kind of know that I’m going to be gone now and not last minute so.
597.64	4.89	At least its about three weeks out or a month out so I can um take time to plan.
