6.92	2.5	This place is kind of cramped, but maybe I'll get used to it.
12.33	3.43	I'm feeling a bit tired and achy from yesterday's workout.
17.72	8.76	Looking forward to going to the lab later and checking on how everything is going on over there.
30.79	5.49	I'm kinda excited for tonight when I get to go play badminton with my friends.
40.66	1.69	Or I guess maybe ping pong.
45.45	4.22	And definitely looking forward to an interview tonight.
51.47	1.72	Probably have to prepare for it a little bit.
56.48	1.54	And I got to make slides for it too.
62.1	1.95	It's pretty loud in here, I can hardly hear myself.
70.28	1.79	I think maybe I'll get used to the noise eventually.
81.91	1.56	I guess tonight's going to be another late night.
91.16	1.31	This machinery is really loud.
99.3	1.42	I wonder what all of the beeping is for.
109.34	1.63	It's actually not too uncomfortable in here.
134.75	2.0	Starting to think about what I might get for lunch.
138.42	3.41	Should I go back to campus before or after?
145.98	2.38	Probably after, so that I don't have to make two trips.
169.34	1.47	Feeling really sore from yesterday.
177.64	2.98	Thinking about home, I kind of miss my dog.
198.33	1.7	I really wish I could be there with him right now.
206.82	5.22	I only have two more months to go before I go back, so it's not too far away.
234.88	1.28	It is getting pretty loud in here.
251.62	1.58	It feels like I'm in a space capsule.
258.4	1.47	Or some sort of castle, I guess.
274.18	3.35	I have quite a bit of work to do this weekend, or I guess this week.
279.87	6.38	I'm gonna wrap up my homework for profsats, and probably start on my other essays.
290.15	6.82	Not to mention planning for a summer vacation trip, which I'm actually really excited about.
300.7	1.45	Yeah, I got to start planning on that soon.
322.5	1.35	What am I going to eat for lunch today?
331.84	11.19	So I guess I'll make it back to campus at 1 or 2, and then probably get lunch, and then go to the library and sit for a bit.
376.66	0.98	Feeling kind of tired.
379.04	1.77	Maybe it's just an early morning, that's why.
389.3	1.91	I'm kind of looking forward to the stories later.
391.79	0.7	Might be intriguing.
411.74	1.4	I really miss my dog right now.
415.08	5.24	I really want to just be home, and lie down on my couch.
439.9	3.05	I really wish the climbing wall was open for spring break.
444.54	1.37	Then at least I'd have something more to do.
447.68	5.44	At least...some of my friends are still here for spring break,
453.15	1.06	so I can hang out with them.
490.9	3.11	It feels kind of weird being in this capsule like thing right now.
497.26	1.54	I'm staring at that white cross.
507.89	1.37	And yeah, it's definitely loud in here.
526.93	1.45	I wonder how there's a screen up there.
555.0	4.82	I think I was trying to think about dinner as well.
560.36	0.72	I'm kind of hungry.
562.22	1.19	I haven't eaten today yet.
568.53	3.67	Maybe I can grab a quick bite after this, before I head off to the lab.
