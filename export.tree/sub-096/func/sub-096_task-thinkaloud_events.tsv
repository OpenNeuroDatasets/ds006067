6.74	2.94	Kind of difficult with the sounds in my ears and GL.
12.79	3.67	But yeah, I'm looking kind of tired right now.
19.55	0.74	There's a wind.
20.46	3.01	The wind is on my arms.
25.98	4.59	And it's really weird talking but not being able to hear myself.
31.14	1.39	So, I have no idea how loud I'm being.
33.7	3.92	Sometimes I'm way too loud, but sometimes I'm not loud enough and it's...
39.41	2.2	It's kind of hard to figure out.
43.43	5.35	But yeah, there's a screen in front of me.
48.83	1.17	It has a white cross on it.
51.29	8.74	I am alive and well, I guess.
62.08	1.53	I have to do transport homework tonight.
64.41	1.68	Transport's going to kick my ass.
66.79	1.32	I haven't studied for it at all.
71.7	6.34	So, let me just go over what I'm supposed to be learning, or what we just learned in the last class.
78.78	3.48	Which was steady state flow and then non-steady state flow.
83.11	1.57	And how long it takes after...
86.02	3.48	Wait a second, if my mouth is moving, is my head also moving when I talk?
92.17	2.7	So, steady state and then non-steady state flow.
95.29	8.82	And how long does it take after the unsteady perturbation happens to recalibrate back to steady state.
105.29	0.81	That was kind of...
106.71	0.98	There's a lot of math involved.
108.28	1.0	I did not pay attention to that.
109.84	0.77	I probably should have.
113.85	0.74	But the TAs?
115.26	3.46	I appreciate their efforts, but they're not very good at teaching.
126.2	1.44	And they forgot to record the Zoom,
127.73	2.24	so I can't even go back and watch it, which sucks.
133.87	1.21	You know, if I go through the math...
137.93	1.05	Should be fine.
141.54	4.43	But the biggest thing is I still have to do the homework, which is due tomorrow.
146.63	0.76	That kind of sucks.
148.28	7.5	Like, I did not do anything yesterday because I was busy meeting people and had a late night.
163.01	0.97	I wonder how long it's been.
164.51	0.73	It's been like...
166.35	6.36	I'm going to guess five minutes because I have no sense of time.
180.44	1.1	My head is kind of empty right now.
182.79	1.42	Like I said, late night.
185.65	0.56	No thoughts.
188.28	0.99	That kind of happens to me a lot.
189.29	4.62	I feel like some people can talk for a very long time without shutting up.
194.99	3.0	But I'm not like that, which is...
202.17	3.41	I guess right now, that's kind of not a good thing.
205.81	2.29	But I'm okay with it.
210.94	1.05	Ten minutes is a long time.
212.85	4.54	Ten minutes is like a whole movement of Elgar's Cello Concerto.
217.43	1.41	Also, my lip just touched the microphone.
228.12	0.7	This is still going.
231.17	6.01	Apparently, silence for longer than 15 minutes above conversation level could cause permanent hearing damage, so...
238.12	0.8	Hope I don't get that.
239.01	4.53	But I feel like I could have gotten that from like orchestra, so...
247.94	1.94	At least I'm being paid for this, hopefully.
256.46	2.55	I don't know, it's quite hard not to move your head when you're talking.
266.72	2.34	I think it's been seven minutes.
271.7	0.59	Should I count?
272.58	3.15	One, two, three.
275.88	0.92	No, that's not going to work.
283.03	3.88	Well, it's like when you're doing a plank, and you can't see the timer.
288.07	2.24	And you just keep going, but it's like, when is it going to end?
290.42	0.66	And it never ends.
291.62	3.08	And then you look at the timer, and it's like, there's five seconds left.
295.68	1.8	So, you almost made it through.
308.63	2.2	I really want to be able to do a two minute plank.
310.86	6.36	Like, I used to be able to do it, maybe before college, but...
319.12	4.95	Now, one minute is kind of hard, so we'll see.
325.15	1.03	Maybe I can work up to it.
340.45	1.21	Could feel my shoulders tensing up.
341.67	2.85	Also, the microphone might be getting lower, which is weird.
348.49	4.68	Like it wasn't touching my mouth before, but now it kind of is.
354.78	2.84	So, that's great.
358.25	0.92	Can I move the mic?
363.03	2.66	If I move the mic, but I don't move my head, it should be fine, right?
370.95	2.28	Probably better to wait until after this.
375.35	4.13	The body forces on the mic are gravity, and...
381.13	1.18	Yeah, that's down, so...
388.58	1.47	The earbud just popped a little bit.
391.0	0.74	Still in, though.
392.16	0.62	Should be fine.
403.03	2.85	I think I was too optimistic with my first two time estimates.
406.06	0.75	It's probably been...
408.21	1.4	Like I'll give it eight minutes now.
410.93	4.08	It feels like there's still a long way to go, but also feels like I've been talking for a long time.
416.05	0.88	I feel really stupid.
422.19	5.04	In order to verbalize your thoughts, don't you first have to have like conscious thoughts first?
427.29	1.84	But most people don't even think like that, so...
430.62	2.48	I don't know, this is kind of interesting.
434.92	4.52	Like not everybody even has a conscious stream of thought in the first place.
440.06	5.02	So, how are they supposed to verbalize what they're thinking if they're not thinking in words, you know?
454.66	1.48	Like I can't verbalize feelings.
457.83	4.06	Like I can't directly verbalize feelings or pictures.
462.73	1.92	And then describing them as if...
466.67	3.2	Well, that's just adding an extra filter between you and then...
472.46	1.45	I don't know, whoever you're communicating to.
475.36	0.66	So that's like...
476.2	0.6	It's kind of meta.
476.87	0.74	This is kind of meta.
479.68	1.48	It's still kind of creepy, but this is fine.
483.32	1.16	I'm like physically fine.
487.14	1.19	I'm like mentally fine.
491.16	1.61	It's just that the sound is kind of loud.
502.35	1.5	Okay, it must have been 9 minutes.
503.88	1.12	I'll give it one more minute.
511.16	10.35	Bro my 9th grade bridge presentation was 10 minutes, and that felt shorter than this.
523.03	8.55	That was with the Navajo Bridge and triangles.
532.88	1.15	Triangles are the coolest shape.
538.49	1.83	Hexagons are the second coolest shape.
551.98	1.64	Heptagons are just disgusting.
555.79	1.45	Pentagons are kind of cool too.
559.78	1.13	Squares are too square.
564.48	1.65	It's weird, there's no shape with two edges.
567.57	1.68	Like you have a line that's just one edge, right?
569.76	1.87	Oh, now I'm actually touching the mic, okay.
572.56	1.54	You have a line that's just one edge.
577.28	1.42	Is it also two edges, or?
579.85	1.1	Cause there's two sides of a line.
588.25	2.71	But a point is like a circle, so that's not a zero.
591.4	1.97	Actually, that is zero edges.
