4.8	2.82	Okay. So, I guess I'm going to think about whatever I need to say.
8.76	1.04	It's pretty cool.
11.4	2.82	I'm thinking about the experiment and what it's going to show.
15.14	3.16	Interested in seeing what my brain looks like.
19.74	2.9	And interested in seeing how this all works…
22.82	1.6	…and the experimental design.
26.12	2.36	After this, I'm thinking that I have to go home.
29.16	3.76	I'm actually moving tomorrow, so I have to pack.
33.16	2.12	I have to make sure I'm getting a few boxes ready.
37.5	4.4	I actually don't know if I have enough boxes, so I might have to go to Home Depot first.
42.74	5.08	It's possible that the movers are going to be coming first thing tomorrow.
48.98	7.12	So, I have to make sure that when I'm packing, I'm packing everything that I need to before they come.
57.8	2.17	Just going through all the rooms in the house.
60.92	2.72	Master bedroom is probably where we need the most work.
64.68	2.0	A few pieces of furniture in there.
66.96	5.48	A few drawers that I need to pack, so the movers can move, at least, the big pieces of furniture.
73.62	8.5	Well, there's a lot of stuff in there too, so it's going to be important to clear, to make sure everything is well-packed…
83.2	4.02	…so they can carry it, so I'm not lugging it across to the new place.
89.84	2.14	There's also a lot that I wanted to donate.
92.62	6.36	I have a couple of piles, but I think I haven't done a very good job in putting those together.
100.16	5.26	Hopefully, we'll have some opportunity to do some of that tonight.
107.46	6.4	Otherwise, going through the other rooms in the house, the kitchen, I think Melissa is taking care of most of that.
114.76	7.44	The first guest bedroom, it's more or less taken care of.
122.29	7.83	I just have to disassemble the bed, which means I have to get the drill from the other house over.
131.56	2.39	Which, actually, I should do on my way home today.
135.63	2.69	That's going to be a 30-step IKEA process.
140.02	3.16	But that'll be good to have it dismantled, so the movers can just move it.
145.44	3.36	The table's already dismantled.
150.29	0.97	The cupboards are empty.
153.14	3.46	The closet has a couple of bags that I should just probably bring downstairs.
157.8	5.08	Then the third bedroom, it's mostly storage boxes and things.
163.33	1.57	Mostly Melissa's stuff.
165.96	2.14	It should all be packed, it should just be ready to go.
169.22	3.56	But the big question is going to be where we should be moving it to in the new house.
174.58	4.72	I'm thinking I'll probably put those boxes in the basement.
181.36	4.42	But I have to really think about that in more detail.
188.48	12.24	Otherwise, I suppose the dining room, there's also a lot of plates and stuff that we need to remove from the cabinets, so they can move the cupboards.
203.9	3.36	Yes, that's going to be a little tricky because that's going to be a lot of fragile stuff.
209.02	1.34	So, I've got to work on that.
210.68	4.6	And then in the foyer, that's going to be a mess.
215.58	0.88	We'll figure that out later.
217.18	2.18	I don't think there's much for the movers to do there.
220.46	2.12	The sunroom, also not much to do.
222.98	0.52	Just furniture.
224.5	3.0	And then the living room, I have to go through all those drawers.
230.12	5.94	But all the major pieces of furniture, the piano, sofas, all that should be ready.
237.94	7.36	That's probably about eight hours of work, so it's probably not the best thing that I'm here doing the experiment, but it'll be okay.
247.38	4.78	Other than that, let's see. I have some grants I still have to work on.
253.48	7.48	I have to do the collaborative agreement between us and the collaborators…
265.06	2.12	…and prepare for the meetings on Thursday.
270.34	12.48	Otherwise, I have a meeting with Sudha coming up on Thursday. I'm starting to review the modeling information that she sent me.
285.38	1.88	And yes, there's quite a lot still to be done.
291.86	1.86	Now I'm trying to come up with things to think about.
297.24	8.16	Thinking it would be really nice to have some time to watch a movie and just chill, but I have to figure out how that's going to happen.
306.56	2.68	We have Allison's wedding to go to this weekend.
310.96	5.38	So, Thursday, Friday, and then Leah is going to visit us on Saturday.
317.94	3.51	That's going to be interesting.
322.09	6.87	It'll be interesting to see how she and Wolfgang are doing, and how she's thinking about the future.
332.76	9.88	Hopefully, I'll have more information from the TCD company about our collaboration with them, so I can talk to Leah about it at that point.
344.72	7.5	And Sunday is the trip to Indiana, so I have quite a lot to do.
359.63	2.53	I'm thinking about my trip to Tanzania recently.
362.8	1.86	That was pretty awesome.
365.43	8.63	It was nice to be able to hang out with Amira and climb Kilimanjaro.
375.76	6.18	Too bad my toenails are all screwed up and I have to wear sandals indefinitely, but it's worth it.
384.82	5.83	It would be interesting to see if we're able to get this off the ground.
390.68	11.32	I have to email, meet her to see if we could set up that collaboration to send business school and policy school students on treks there.
403.66	8.92	Still not sure if we should incorporate climbing for the summer for all the students, especially if they haven't trained, but it would be really cool.
418.51	5.95	It probably makes sense to call Oma and catch up with her, call my mom and dad and catch up with them.
434.5	3.58	I don't know if I have any other major thoughts to think about right now.
440.6	6.55	I guess I can think about a movie I watched recently or a movie I want to watch.
449.8	2.61	I watched the fourth installment of the Matrix movies.
452.59	0.91	That was pretty lame.
454.5	5.08	It was nice that it was so meta but the casting was all wrong.
461.72	2.26	It's sad that they made the movie.
473.04	2.91	Clinically, there's a lot to look forward to, I guess.
478.43	0.95	I'm going back to work…
480.48	2.88	…in the ICU again next week.
484.92	10.94	Hopefully, the feedback I give to my fellow is going to make her a better physician, to focus on her soft skill development.
499.08	2.95	Hopefully, that feedback session isn't going to backfire.
502.52	2.9	I don't think it will.
515.66	9.94	In terms of relationships, oh, I guess I need to call Nick and talk to him as well.
527.02	2.78	We're planning a trip to go…
533.74	3.34	…tour the south of France in July.
538.46	6.82	It'll be amazing if Melissa can come as well. But otherwise, Vishan and Rajeev might be joining us there.
546.42	1.3	That'll be really nice.
564.02	0.4	I have to book my tickets for that time period.
573.8	2.4	Should I be paying more attention to the news?
576.56	0.73	Probably not.
579.87	2.09	Nothing to actually act on.
586.66	2.3	Oh, I really should talk to Manoj.
590.54	2.77	I bet he's getting involved with the election stuff again.
593.76	1.58	It would be interesting to see where he's at.
596.18	0.98	It's been a long time.
599.52	2.46	I think he's supposed to try and find...
