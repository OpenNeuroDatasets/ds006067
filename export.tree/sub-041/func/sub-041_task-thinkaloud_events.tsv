10.71	3.95	So this morning I went to my first class at 10:00.
16.13	3.43	I woke up early 'cause I got a phone call, but I missed it.
19.56	4.71	And then my roommate left earlier than me.
24.27	5.54	I think that's the first time I woke up, but I fell asleep again after that.
29.81	7.8	Um I was walking to my first class, which was my computer class.
37.61	3.04	And it was easy.
40.65	5.98	We had an assignment in class that we did, and I finished it pretty fast.
46.63	6.08	Then I went to get coffee, and then I came back.
54.78	3.62	Um I came back here last night.
58.4	4.49	I live pretty close, so I came back in the evening.
62.89	6.44	I thought I was gonna come back sooner, but I ended up coming back later than I thought.
69.33	5.48	So I was able to spend some more time with my sisters right before I left.
74.81	9.48	Um And then later tonight I have my orchestra rehearsal.
84.29	15.38	I'm trying to... I think that my dad wants to try to come to our concert, but we'll see if he can come, because my younger sister is supposed to be hanging out with some friends that night or something.
99.67	11.06	But hopefully he can come, because I remember he wasn't really able to come to a lot of my concerts when I was in like high school, but maybe he can come. We'll see.
110.73	5.72	I have rehearsals every night, almost every night this week.
116.45	7.57	I have one tonight, and then one on Wednesday, or not Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
124.02	7.89	And then on Wednesday I have rehearsal with my chamber group.
131.91	7.3	I'm in a piano trio, and it's the first time I've been in a piano trio, so it's been different.
139.21	7.23	I was worried it was going to be hard to get along with my other two members.
146.44	8.02	I play cello, so there's a violin and a piano, but it's pretty easy to work with them, which is good.
157.46	6.04	At the end of classes in two weeks, hopefully I can spend some more time with my friends.
163.5	6.53	We're planning on having a sleepover or something like that to bring like pizza and other snacks.
170.03	14.6	We held one right before Thanksgiving break and it was really fun, but I have a presentation at the end of classes, so hopefully we can still work it out.
188.67	3.53	We went to Streets Market together and got food.
192.2	5.85	And so we got like canned bubble tea, which was really good.
198.05	10.26	It was the second time I got that bubble tea, because the first time I got it, I was... It was when my older sister and my mom and my younger sister were visiting me.
208.31	5.62	And so my sister was like, You should try it as a snack, and so I got it.
213.93	1.04	It was really good.
214.97	2.54	And so I got it again with my friends.
220.1	6.48	That day we also went to the DMC and borrowed a projector to watch a movie together.
226.58	11.7	And we had to carry it all the way from the DMC to Streets Market back to McCoy, which is where my friend and I both live right now.
238.28	8.76	I've been thinking about where I'm going to live next year, because I'll be a sophomore.
247.04	8.98	Hopefully I'll be able to live pretty close like Charles Comet or McCoy, but I'm not sure obviously.
256.02	8.98	But at least, I think that living in a suite is a lot better than living in the AMRS like some of my friends do.
268.79	3.01	My roommates and I get along really well.
272.93	9.89	I've heard like from my friends that they've had problems with their roommates, but I was really lucky and my suitemates and I get along well.
282.82	1.18	I don't really see them that often.
284.0	8.03	I pretty much just see my roommate in the morning and then in the evening when we both come back.
292.03	3.8	But I think that makes it easier to get along with them.
297.1	10.25	I think next week I have to do the chores for our suite, which I'll have to clean the bathroom and kitchen, take out the trash.
309.35	3.04	When I was at home, I mostly did the laundry.
314.43	6.21	Sometimes I did it with my younger sister, but I was usually doing the laundry and then taking care of my cat.
323.09	6.3	My cat was like especially cuddly last night, or yesterday, right before I left.
329.39	1.73	Usually he doesn't cuddle at all.
332.16	6.44	Usually he just walks away from me or ignores me, but he was very cuddly yesterday.
341.62	5.7	He used to be really shy, but then he started getting bossier because he got more comfortable.
348.0	8.44	We got him, I think, four years ago because he was my sister's cat, but now he lives with us.
359.61	6.71	Later this month, or next month, later in December, my older sister is getting married.
367.09	3.09	And so we're gonna go to her wedding at the end of December.
373.17	3.95	And then also later next month, I have my finals.
377.12	4.58	I have my Econ final right before my sister's wedding.
384.02	7.43	It's like open note, but I'm still nervous about it because I like need a good grade on it, but I think it'll be okay.
394.4	2.26	Hopefully I'll be back home for a while.
398.02	7.99	I don't know what I'm gonna do for intro session yet, if I'm going to do something online or in person.
406.01	5.76	I looked at the classes and they seem kind of interesting, but I don't know which one I would do yet.
412.9	3.45	I was hoping to find something music-related, but I'm not sure.
416.35	4.35	Not... They don't have a lot, which I was a little bit surprised about.
421.88	3.9	But maybe I can try something art-related, or writing.
426.73	4.76	Because I used to write a lot, but I haven't written anything in a long time.
431.49	3.72	But, it'll... I think it'll be fun to go back to it, maybe.
436.62	4.44	But I haven't been in like a workshop in like years, I think.
442.47	1.81	But it would be fun to try it again.
446.54	9.48	I tried on my dress for my sister's wedding a few days ago, or I had it a week ago, and then I tried it again when I went back home.
457.84	3.67	I thought it was too big, but I tried it again and it was fine.
462.1	2.63	I just need like a safety pin for it, I think.
464.73	3.13	And then it's a little bit long, but it's fine.
468.72	4.9	My older sister said it was fine because it's just for taking pictures and things like that.
475.34	8.8	My brother-in-law's family is from Hawaii, so we're gonna be in Hawaii for the wedding, and we'll take pictures on the beach or something.
484.8	7.85	It's like really early in the morning, and then we take pictures and then I don't really know what's gonna happen.
493.28	3.67	It's my... It's the first wedding in our family, pretty much.
498.21	7.98	Because the rest of our family is in China, and we... I haven't... I don't know.
506.19	1.38	I... I don't know them that well.
509.15	7.99	And obviously my older sister is the first one having a wedding in our family, so it's... It's like the first wedding for us.
522.03	8.44	I don't know my in-laws, I... We had like dinner with them, but after COVID, it's been a while since we've seen them again.
530.47	3.22	And then I've been at college for the past few months.
534.46	6.58	I think they visited maybe a year or two ago before COVID, but I haven't seen them since.
542.68	10.65	But they send us some really good snacks sometimes from Hawaii, like macadamia nuts that my mom likes, and some other like crackers and chips that are really good.
556.68	11.75	Later at HSL rehearsal tonight, I think we're performing with the soloist, which... And he's a clarinet professor at Peabody.
570.74	7.35	I used to take lessons at Peabody when I was in high school, and I... Also went in elementary school actually.
578.68	7.89	I started taking lessons there when I was in third grade, and I... I had the same teacher for a really long time.
588.2	7.44	I actually saw him when I went to a concert recently at Shriver, and it was really good to see him again.
599.13	6.17	I haven't been back, well I actually visited Peabody recently-ish, it was like a month ago.
