8.38	8.98	I think this is really a cool experiment, and it's not as scary as I thought it was going to be.
17.36	8.76	I really like this tunnel thing that makes it feel like I'm still in the room rather than trapped looking at a wall.
26.12	4.17	It feels a lot more free and open and bright than I thought it would be.
31.56	10.43	The actual width of the machine feels a little tight on my elbows which makes me wonder how it works for larger people.
41.99	7.03	I don't think that Landon could do this because his shoulders are so broad, or at least he would be pretty uncomfortable in here.
50.79	7.98	I wonder if they're still taking people for this study because I think he would love to be part of it, and I also want to compare his memory to mine.
59.55	4.44	I'm sure he would do a lot better than me, but I still am pretty curious.
65.75	14.19	I think more than feeling nervous about this physical space, I feel nervous about my actual memory and recall and being compared to other people.
80.36	11.29	I know I shouldn't assign any sort of meaning to my results or my memory because my memory is just my memory, but I'm still feeling a little anxious about that.
95.55	5.76	I wonder how long it takes after this and if I'll make it to school pick up on time.
101.87	12.36	Hopefully, Landon set an alarm so that he wakes up and sees my location and goes to the school if necessary, but I'll probably be able to make it on time.
115.19	4.08	I'm glad I was able to find a close parking spot, so I'll probably have to run out of here pretty fast.
121.4	7.62	I wonder if Liam's available to shoot hoops with Conrad after school, or if we should invite other friends over since it's so sunny and nice out.
129.65	1.05	Or maybe we should go to the park.
133.5	2.04	I still need to teach Sylvie how to ride her bike.
135.54	6.44	I keep telling her I'll do that once it's warmer out, but loading stuff up in the back of the car sounds hard.
142.8	5.21	Oh, I still have a bunch of stuff in the back of the car that I need to take to the dump.
149.28	7.07	If I'm done here on time or after school, I'll run to the dump really fast and get all of that stuff out.
156.99	1.68	I wonder why they didn't pick it up from the curb.
158.98	1.32	That's frustrating.
163.65	4.54	I wonder when I should post about our house on the neighborhood Facebook page.
169.1	6.43	I should probably wait to see if Landon hears back from the guy in Rome about housing there.
177.94	4.72	I want to get it all in place, but it's going to take some time and I should be patient.
184.06	3.36	I wonder if that lady's going to respond to me about listing our house.
188.41	5.4	It's probably just more reliable to rent it out short term to somebody in the area.
195.31	4.54	Hopefully, someone in the neighborhood, but maybe it would be better if it was someone I don't know.
200.98	4.44	Maybe a traveling nurse or somebody would want a house for a month.
207.73	4.39	Airbnb seems too complicated, and I don't want to clean out all of my closets.
213.6	1.93	Do we have any activities tonight?
215.53	4.26	No. I need to cancel Sylvie's ballet and tell them that she's not coming back.
220.83	2.13	I think that's all we would have normally tonight.
224.19	7.02	And then tomorrow I have to figure out who is going to help me with rides.
232.08	6.67	I'm going to be doing my class at the YMCA at 5:30.
240.42	1.05	It should work.
241.64	4.4	I need to fill out the passport forms tomorrow after school.
246.67	2.14	Maybe at bedtime so I can think more clearly.
250.67	10.99	And then I'll have them all ready and all of the copies made of the birth certificates, and organize them nicely in hopes that it won't be total chaos when we go to the actual office.
262.45	2.91	I hope it doesn't actually take as long as we're scheduled for.
266.36	4.26	If we have everything filled out and we just need our pictures taken.
270.78	2.82	Hopefully, the kids cooperate for their passport photos.
273.73	4.58	That's probably going to be the hardest part of the experience.
279.38	1.6	I wonder what the turnaround time is.
281.7	0.86	We should be good.
283.1	1.41	We have like 12 weeks.
285.92	2.4	I bet it's less than that.
288.77	1.59	I don't want to pay for them to be expedited.
291.46	4.66	I wonder if there's anything I need to order for Easter, and if I should have it shipped to Arizona.
297.12	3.42	I should probably do that this evening to make sure it gets there on time.
301.08	6.02	Maybe something like a water bottle or cleats, or whatever they need for spring sports.
309.32	2.4	Hopefully, my mom got stuff and it'll be enough.
314.11	1.6	I wonder if I should get myself something.
317.47	4.28	Like I need a new suitcase or a swimsuit, or something like that.
323.35	2.75	I wonder if there's anything in the land I would want.
327.78	1.41	Nothing I can really think of.
330.86	4.36	It'll be so nice to go and be warm, and hopefully it will be relaxing.
337.4	0.67	I need to order.
338.29	2.63	I need to see what everybody has to wear for Disney Land.
341.38	7.34	I wonder if I need to get more themed stuff for the kids to wear, or if they even care about that sort of thing.
349.63	5.85	Like Mickey ears, but we're flying Spirit Airlines so I basically can take nothing.
355.94	2.03	Oh, I paid for a checked bag.
358.93	1.4	I can take more stuff.
360.78	4.27	I should think about maybe Star Wars or Mickey clothes for the kids to make it more fun.
366.45	3.63	I wonder where mom got for us to stay, if it's close by.
371.17	0.86	This could be so fun.
372.03	1.28	Hopefully the lines aren't crazy.
373.98	7.22	Maybe it'll get a rainy day and we'll get lucky and the lines won't be crazy, but it is spring break so it's probably going to be terrible.
381.78	1.5	Maybe I should have a bunch of snacks.
384.19	8.34	Whatever I pack for the airplane I should pack way more so that our backpacks are set and ready to go for while we're in the park waiting in lines.
393.85	4.63	Wow, I feel really thirsty from talking for this long.
399.61	4.08	I wonder if I'm going to be able to do this how thirsty I'm going to feel.
404.91	0.82	I shouldn't think about it.
405.73	1.32	It's going to make me feel worse.
408.45	6.31	I keep imagining that I'm going to have an itch on my face or something like that, but I'm sure it's just because I can't move.
416.8	15.15	I should tell my anxiety group at school about this experience and how I've had to think positive thoughts and take deep breaths, and stay calm not to totally freak out and how useful the things that we're learning group can be for different life experiences.
434.53	3.99	Last time I had an MRI was when I was pregnant with Myles.
439.25	1.31	That's 10 years ago.
442.42	0.77	That's crazy.
443.92	1.4	I wonder what my brain's going to look like.
446.58	1.69	Will there be anything unique about it?
448.27	8.48	I wonder if people come in and do studies like this and like mysteriously find brain tubers that they had no symptoms of.
458.79	1.0	That would be really bad.
461.1	11.61	I guess really good if it's being caught prior to when there are symptoms but also I hope there's nothing wrong with my brain.
474.42	0.82	Kind of crazy.
476.73	7.99	I wonder if there's a correlation between how people's brains look and their memory.
486.76	1.59	Maybe Landon will be able to tell me.
488.92	1.09	Hopefully.
490.78	1.12	Hopefully, my brain is okay.
493.88	7.74	I feel like if I would have drank a little more caffeine before this I would have been more alert, and maybe been able to have better recall.
505.38	1.04	Now I'm feeling thirsty again.
508.26	2.96	I should have gotten a soda or something like that on my way in.
512.0	2.77	Good thing I at least went to the bathroom before I came in here.
515.4	0.98	That would be stressful.
519.28	2.33	I don't like this pull socks on my finger.
522.38	2.32	It's always the worst part of being at the hospital.
525.69	3.09	I don't know why it bothers me so much.
530.91	3.72	Otherwise, it's not too cold and I'm really glad I don't have to be in a hospital gown.
535.44	2.04	I kept wondering if I was going to have to change my clothes.
537.48	3.44	It's really nice to just be in my regular street clothes to do this.
543.88	3.59	This is an interesting experience.
548.64	1.95	I hope it's okay with everyone at home.
550.59	1.41	I hope the boys are napping.
552.0	1.58	I hope Landon's sleeping.
555.17	5.08	This was his idea so he can't be frustrated that he doesn't get any sleep today.
562.38	1.77	I'm going to miss him being on nights.
564.15	0.77	Oh, shoot.
564.92	3.4	I need to cancel my hair appointment for Wednesday.
569.73	1.14	I'll do it on the dry perm.
571.77	5.31	But I wonder if there's any chance they'll have an opening because I really want to have my hair colored before spring break.
578.16	1.77	Such a bummer that I have to cancel.
581.79	1.51	I doubt she has openings especially.
584.16	2.9	This time of year and everyone trying to get in before she has her baby.
588.2	1.89	I'm so frustrated.
591.54	2.52	If I don't do it now, I wonder when I'll be able to do it.
595.47	1.5	Definitely before July.
598.83	2.05	I wonder if there's the one in Arizona that could.
