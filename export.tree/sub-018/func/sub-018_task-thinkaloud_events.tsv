55.52	4.4	My professors have been very helpful during office hours
60.38	5.94	Um, the general manager at my job, he’s being very helpful, too
67.04	3.79	Um, I’m just in a environment that embraces me
71.44	4.58	That embraces the open… there’s a open door policy
76.53	14.2	If I have any concerns or any complaints, I can go and talk to the ge-, to the general manager, and, um, he will take his time to listen to me no matter how- how busy he is
90.8	4.43	Um, I’m very thankful to be in that type of environment

101.58	3.99	Um, I had some cucumbers, some bananas
105.69	3.63	I had the- the salad bar at Fogo de Chao
109.95	4.62	Their, um, soup was delicious, was absolutely delicious
115.13	6.49	Um, um, so grateful that the pandemic is almost coming to an end
122.23	10.51	Um, it’s coming to an end by, um, it’s the first time where you get to… I don’t have to wear my mask at work
133.38	16.33	I don’t have to, um, so they, pandemic, um, it’s sure is slowing down, because, um, we don’t have to wear a mask, um, even though it’s incoors, we don’t have to, um, social distance anymore
150.45	19.79	Um, what I- what I learned about this pandemic is, um, everything could- could change in a day, and- and nothing is permanent, so I’m- I’m very grateful for what I- what I have right now and just, um, everybody s- supporting me
170.29	12.82	So, um, I’m- I’m also thankful for later today, um, I get to learn about uh, anatomy and physiology by a resident physician
183.33	5.28	Um, think the- the residents they are, uh, super hardworking
189.01	10.25	Uh, they display excellence on a daily basis and, uh, they just have some traits I want to emulate
199.43	7.79	I mean, they are just, um, they go the extra mile for me, they make the- the PowerPoint for me
207.79	5.18	Uh, fifty slides, um, and they just very good at teaching
213.44	3.45	So, I’m- I’m very grateful and blessed to have them
216.98	10.52	Also, on Friday, I’m going to, um, participate on tomorrow, Friday is- is pay day, so I’m- I’m happy and
227.64	7.45	I’m also going to participate in the, um, uh, Zoom whitening
235.15	12.7	So, Zoom whitening is- is a treatment that will make my teeth look, uh, complete, uh, very, very white, like a glowy white
248.0	4.72	I can’t-, I can’t see-, I can’t wait to see how good they look
253.41	16.05	I’m just so excited to participate in the program and, um, and the dentist, uh, Dr. Gary Reznik, he’s doing the Zoom whitening for me, so I’m- I’m very excited
270.23	6.98	So, over this year, during the pandemic, I think I learned a lot of lessons
277.77	13.74	I mean, oh, the number one lessons, um, I learned from the people, not only the residents, it’s- it’s just a, um, always, um, be kind to people
292.1	8.87	Um, just going the extra mile for people and, um, that’s why, um, I- I like giving back to my community
301.67	10.95	Um, recently, just like a- a week ago, I started volunteering… I started volunteering for a program called, uh, Reading Partners
313.14	24.09	Reading Partners is a program where- where I, um, volunteer to serve as a reading tutor for- for a so I do that once a week just to give back to the community because I want to help people as much my, um, resident physician tutors have helped me
337.27	18.17	I’m- I’m very grateful and blessed to, um, be in their presence to- to have their help, because, um, because of them I’m- I’m making, um, As and Bs in school and I’m hope to emulate some- some of the traits that they have
356.12	19.15	I’m also, um, very, very grateful for, um, the… the tremendous amount of, um, the tremendous amount of support I have, I mean, I- I love the- the city of Baltimore
375.99	10.35	All the, um, I really enjoy the live music, the- the live music, um, all the bars in Fells Point
387.05	9.75	Um, I’m not a- a big social drinker but I- I drink I- I- I like to- to buy, uh, Budweiser’s, it’s my favorite drink
396.94	8.2	I like Budweiser’s and Starbucks and the thing I like most about Baltimore is, um, the live music
405.26	7.64	All the bars… and most of the bars in Fells Point, they have, uh, live music seven days a week
413.47	7.19	On Saturdays and Sundays, um, they have, um, three- three bands coming in
420.73	12.76	So the bands are from, um, I remember the Cat’s Eye Pub, they have, um, uh, music starting at twelve all the way to like one-thirty in morning
434.03	7.74	I think, um, the live music scene is something that is very, very special to Baltimore
442.4	16.84	And so one of the most ex- exciting things I learned about, um, the- the nervous system, um, is- is it got all of this, um, from the resident physician
459.88	5.9	Um, I learn- I learned a lot but one of the most exciting things is about, um, the nervous system
466.38	21.72	So the nervous system so they got, um, different, um, millions and millions of neurons and these neurons are firing all over the place and they are working by, um, they work the same way as, uh, muscle tissue or cardiac tissue
488.11	14.97	So they are, uh, three types of, uh, tissue in- in a body so they, um, car- cardiac tissue, mu- muscle tissue, and, sk- skeletal- skeletal, uh, muscle
503.74	2.95	Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle
507.36	8.93	So uh, cardiac muscle is the- the most unique I think because it has, uh, automaticity
516.95	24.8	Automaticity is the, uh, property that is generated when, uh, th- the heart just beat, just beats by its own, and, um, the action potentials are generated like, um… I think um, and something is, um, depolarized and repolarized
542.36	5.23	Um, so we talk, well we talked about ca- ca- cardiology as a system
547.67	6.17	We talked about something like uh, is- is- ischemia
554.47	14.05	Like, uh, ischemia is something that just causes the- the blood in, uh, not to fill- fill up in the heart, so it’s- it’s like a, uh, blockage
569.06	5.0	Uh, we talked about, uh, how- how to, uh, read an EKG
574.68	13.69	So- so I think a EKG is pretty cool, it’s- it's when they put the pa- pads on your heart and, um, so what you do is you read the, um, P-wave
588.9	12.89	So the P-wave is- is the first deflection in the EKG and, um, the, then we have, um, something called the QRS complex
