onset	duration	transcript
5.66	4.59	Well, this task has always been hard to do.
11.22	0.95	It was quite hard the last time.
13.5	0.43	I guess...
15.8	5.88	It seems like there should be a prompt or something to start people off, you know.
22.76	1.37	If not, then just...
26.18	1.04	I don't really know what to think.
28.41	5.65	I guess the sound of the machine is quite loud, so it doesn't really help to think of something.
36.37	6.05	I had a thought that I was thinking about before I started this study, this line here.
43.35	0.56	The machine is...
46.06	9.19	How similar the fMRI is to the tasks that we give our animals to do in the lab.
56.57	13.08	I guess the main difference is that with animals, we don't do so much to make sure that they are as comfortable as the human participants are.
71.42	12.99	Basically, we just stick the head in a position and then put them in a box to scan them, which is kind of similar to what's going on now.
87.86	0.5	I don't know.
89.99	11.67	People have been saying that this type of study is not the most natural for the animal.
102.05	13.06	Putting an animal in a box and playing sounds to give them stimuli and seeing how they react to it is not the most natural thing for the mouse to do.
115.18	12.92	But if you think about it, with humans, when you put them in an fMRI and make them look at a screen and do whatever tasks, it's also not the most natural thing to do.
128.16	12.13	But we still do it, and it does seem to affect our trust in the results of brain scans.
140.92	9.5	So, either there's something different from the way that we are behaving in the scanner compared to how animals are doing it, or else...
153.94	1.15	I don't think there should be any...
157.77	5.1	well, this sums up the concerns of how unnatural this type of scans are.
164.68	4.54	Not super informative.
170.94	1.49	Well, that's just a thought.
174.01	4.4	It's kind of weird to see the cross on a screen.
178.49	2.78	It kind of looks like stars now.
187.19	5.19	I guess the other thing is that the mirror here is kind of spackled
194.78	3.4	I don't know what it is, but it looks dirty.
200.25	2.58	I feel like I should clean it.
204.42	18.22	But yeah, before the study, the screens had a nice background, kind of like a sand dune or some sort of mountain or something.
225.39	4.2	Yeah, that looks nice, and it kind of reminds me of the movie Dune.
229.95	5.57	I guess the second part of the first book is now coming out.
236.44	1.73	It's interesting.
239.36	9.68	I can't remember if the guy who played Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy is in it.
251.68	1.05	I'm not sure what his name is.
253.35	1.16	Oh, Dave Bautista.
257.56	8.37	I'm thinking about a recent interview that he was giving about how he wanted to be in more serious roles.
267.57	11.34	I guess the actor they were comparing him to was The Rock, and how do both ex-wrestlers who transitioned to acting.
279.5	4.63	Yeah, I guess we all kind of know that, like wrestling...
285.88	8.24	In WWE or WF, there's more performance than actual sports.
295.62	11.26	It's interesting that there's only a few people who made the move from performance with wrestling to go into acting.
308.67	7.31	There are two of them, and Dave Bautista says that he wants to be in serious roles.
316.88	9.37	Also, interesting side note is that he is part Filipino, maybe half, maybe a quarter, I don't know.
327.1	18.3	I can't really tell, but once you know about it, it seems quite obvious that he has some facial features that make him look Filipino.
346.29	12.42	But then, back to the interview about him wanting to be in a serious role, I guess they were talking about how he needs to be in a film with a role that's written for him.
359.88	12.54	He's in one that's coming up in February, the one by, um, Night Shyamalan, whatever his last name is, about the cabin at the end of the world.
374.84	1.23	It's called A Knock at the Cabin.
378.61	7.48	I don't know, the premise looks kind of weird, I can't believe there was ever a comic book or graphic novel.
387.3	10.08	It doesn't seem to be anything super interesting for someone to write a comic about, let alone a movie.
397.49	23.85	But it's highly rated, highly anticipated, and I'm not sure if I would want to go and watch this in a cinema, but I guess depending on how well the reviews are, I think nowadays there's no real reason to watch movies in a cinema anymore.
422.51	12.91	Because it's all too hyped up, and you can't really know from the trailers or from people talking about it if it's something that's worth watching.
435.95	17.16	Usually you gotta wait until it's been out for a while, and if people are still talking about it, or some sort of award, then you know that it's actually pretty good, and then you go and watch it.
453.21	8.81	I think last year, one of the good movies that I'm glad to have heard about is the movie called The Worst Person in the World.
462.87	2.86	I think it's Danish, I can't remember if it's Danish or Swedish.
468.71	8.84	Not too much plot, but it's very interesting, and I guess I always like how that kind of movie unfolds.
480.92	14.44	I don't know if this year there'll be anything different, just thinking of the scene in the trailer where the protagonist is running around town with a time trolls, and she's just running down the road.
498.23	12.85	It's very interesting, it's not a completely new idea, or even a novel way of shooting it.
512.59	5.23	Maybe it's just how well it contributes to the overall tone and theme of the movie.
518.87	1.2	That makes it a...
521.99	1.54	yeah, makes it...
524.77	6.47	a nice whole.
534.09	1.1	I'm glad to have watched it.
536.78	1.94	Hopefully there's something like this this year.
539.64	2.27	I don't know, nothing really sticks out right now.
542.04	11.01	There's a few big name directors and movies coming out, but you can't really trust them nowadays.
554.44	21.99	I know people say that someone has a style, but if you only produce one or two movies, or maybe five or six, how much can you call something a style compared to just a one-off kind of thing?
579.7	9.89	What is the minimum number of observations you need to be considered stylistic, rather than just something that is happening.
590.87	9.43	I guess for people like Wes Anderson, where they do have a distinct visual style and the kind of choices, the kind of montage, or...
