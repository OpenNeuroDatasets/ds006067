8.5	3.34	I feel like I’ve never thought out loud when there’s so much noise around me.
13.12	1.54	So this is a little bit strange.
15.4	11.72	Well what’s interesting to me right now is that the cross looks yellow and then next to it looks like there’s a blue dot but I don’t know if these colors are actually on screen or if I’m just imagining it.
27.46	4.51	I also feel like the beeping noise, I thought about it earlier.
32.14	5.08	It’s actually quite cool because I feel like, in a sense it’s almost like surround sound.
37.86	9.54	I feel like it could be eight D audio or if the noise moves around from the left side to the right side of my brain, I can actually physically sense it.
47.86	14.53	I feel like that would be super cool because I’ve seen youtube videos that have that function where if you go on it, it sounds like someone is opening a door on the left side of your body but actually it’s just the sound.
62.49	1.46	No one is opening the door.
71.2	1.72	I really want to scratch my nose.
72.96	3.54	It’s not even itchy but I just feel this need to twitch.
76.78	4.77	I feel like lying down horizontally just always makes me tired.
81.85	11.21	So I wonder if people are able to close their eyes while they’re in a horizontal position and not fall asleep and literally just be horizontal with their eyes closed.
93.16	3.81	Because I feel like if I were like that, I would definitely fall asleep.
97.54	4.63	I think even if there were noise in the background, I would still fall asleep too.
105.16	9.42	Because I think with meditation too, you’re supposed to not think about anything but then if you don’t think about anything, your brain is just empty how do you not fall asleep?
115.23	3.33	How do you not think about anything but still remain conscious?
118.86	3.01	I think that’s super strange and lax to me.
123.8	2.13	I also think the screen got brighter.
125.95	5.59	I feel like it used to be a yellow cross on top of a black background.
131.54	4.4	But now it’s like a light aquamarine color.
137.36	1.39	Perhaps not aquamarine.
140.81	2.32	It’s like cyan with a tinge of yellow.
143.51	1.15	It’s a gradient.
144.76	3.23	The right side is more yellow and the left side is more blue.
149.64	1.64	And there’s also lines on it.
151.63	3.63	So it’s not just solid color, it’s like textured.
156.75	8.24	Either way, I think being in this machine makes me feel like an astronaut or at least I’m in some sort of sci fi movie.
166.52	3.54	I just feel like I’m moving but not moving.
170.6	1.48	Maybe I’m inching along.
172.49	12.44	Like the speed is so fast you don’t actually feel like you’re moving anywhere but you’re actually going so so so fast that you’re moving at like Match speed, Mach however you pronounce it.
185.5	4.25	Because when you’re on an airplane you don’t feel like you’re moving, but you are.
189.87	6.95	You’re just literally going from one continent to another in the span of like 7 to 13 hours.
197.81	1.7	But as a passenger you don’t feel like.
199.52	6.65	But if you were on the outside of the airplane and you weren’t holding on tightly, it would be game over for you.
207.72	1.51	Also when you’re on an airplane.
211.86	4.09	I feel like if you were able to be on the outside of an airplane that would be so cool.
216.66	6.36	I feel like you see that in animated movies but you wouldn’t actually be able to do that in real life would you?
223.67	3.83	Because it would be so cold in higher atmospheres.
228.04	1.95	You would actually just crystalize.
231.04	4.79	I wonder how cold it is because on the screen it says like negative 55 degrees.
237.27	2.55	Or actually I can’t exactly remember but I feel like it did.
240.3	4.81	I feel like it could be from negative 55 to negative 80 which is too cold.
245.16	8.24	That’s like the freezers that we have in lab and if you stick your hand in there a little bit you already feel like you want to leave asap.
254.97	2.35	Also there’s so many things you can do on an airplane.
258.53	8.48	Like if you were able to coast around outside then you could hypothetically jump on the clouds and eat them.
268.4	5.64	They would just taste like water, but in my mind they could taste like cotton candy.
274.63	9.42	I feel like it would look especially pretty during sunset, dusk, and dawn because then it would be like actually pink colored.
285.1	9.21	Or actually, it depends on what altitude that you’re on because if you’re too high up then the clouds wouldn’t be fluffy enough and also like.
295.3	7.23	Maybe you’re so high that it's just always dark like if the sun actually rose would you be able to see it if you were so so so high up?
303.47	10.17	Feel like these are the types of questions I would ask Google but then I always end up forgetting whenever I have to ask Google, so then I just have these thoughts but they go unanswered.
316.29	8.42	I also feel like whenever I have to think out loud, which is whenever I think, I’m just thinking about what I have to do next.
325.71	2.07	I feel like today is a pretty packed day.
330.87	5.7	I mean once I get back home, hopefully around 6 o clock, I’ll probably make myself some dinner.
337.32	6.12	And I really think that I should eat some more vegetables because I have not been eating enough vegetables this week.
344.24	3.46	I think I’ve just been eating tomatoes and onions.
348.15	1.09	I think that’s all I have left.
349.92	4.82	I should make a grocery order but I’m going to be gone this weekend so I don’t think it’s worth it.
354.74	3.96	I think I should just place a grocery order when I get back on Monday.
360.2	6.57	But nevertheless, I think I can make myself some tomato and eggs because that would be quite delightful.
367.22	3.61	And then because I don’t have white rice and I don’t like eating brown rice.
370.84	1.84	Also the brown rice isn’t even mine.
373.33	2.17	I think I will just have it with noodles.
376.13	1.78	Or maybe I just won’t even have it with noodles.
377.96	1.9	Maybe I will just have tomatoes and eggs.
380.57	5.56	But the thing is, if you don’t eat any carbs with your meal, you don’t feel satiated.
386.14	2.09	You still feel like you want to eat something else.
390.5	2.96	And that is why I should have noodles.
393.54	7.96	But also I feel like tomatoes and eggs would go nice with thick noodles but I only have thin noodles.
402.02	9.28	See I chose thin noodles because they’re easier to cook but sometimes it just does not fulfill your noodle desires.
413.41	1.21	So I can have that.
415.87	4.59	And I’ll probably use one tomato, two eggs or three.
420.96	3.83	And I gotta drink a lot of water because I haven’t been drinking enough water these days.
425.35	12.34	I feel like at most I drink four to five cups a day, which is far off from the recommended eight cups or even like two liters.
439.34	2.72	Then after dinner, I’ll probably go to the gym.
442.49	8.36	I hope that I can play better this time because I feel like on Tuesday I was not performing at my best and this always happens.
450.93	8.29	Whenever I perform really well like I did on Saturday, next time I always end up being not so great like less than average.
459.86	5.46	I just feel like my performance is always so um not stable.
465.76	2.81	Like it’s not steady, it wavers a lot.
468.8	9.09	And I want my skills and performance to be a more steady level because I think like that would just make me feel better.
478.02	3.78	I don’t know why my performance is so up and down up and down.
483.65	9.03	But uh I feel like when I do perform well I feel really happy but because I’m doing so great I expect that next time but then it doesn’t happen next time.
493.3	4.76	And because I’m doing less than what I think I should be doing, I get kind of upset at myself.
499.76	3.84	And I think the problem is like I feel really dense.
503.73	1.25	I feel like lead.
505.06	1.5	I feel like my feet can’t move as fast.
506.72	4.54	And then also when I’m gripping my racquet I feel like I can’t grip it well.
511.79	7.68	Like my hand is holding on to it and clutching it tightly but at the same time I could just let go so easily and let it fall onto the ground.
519.79	3.19	And I feel like I don’t have any strength like.
523.23	4.26	I’m gripping so hard but at the same time it’s like I’m not.
528.62	1.26	It was very difficult.
530.37	2.32	Plus my hand was shaking last time.
533.46	6.02	And I don’t know why maybe it was just the caffeine but that was something that I had in the morning.
539.63	2.91	I guess I also took many sips right before going.
543.68	17.15	I think there’s just too many confounders and that is difficult for me to make a conclusion because I also ate a lot right before going on Saturday so maybe eating food gives you energy and I didn’t really give I didn’t really eat food on Tuesday to give myself energy.
562.85	1.71	So what should I do today then?
565.11	2.89	Hopefully hopefully I can play better.
568.42	4.14	I will definitely eat food even if I’m not too hungry.
572.56	1.24	I think I should.
574.27	1.69	Maybe I should drink water.
576.01	21.35	And then I think my body feels quite uh tense and sore from the gym yesterday but you just have to ride it out and fight through the pain because this is how muscles grow how you get stronger I believe.
598.35	6.78	Yeah, but then kind of disappointed that I can’t stay for the entirety of the night because at nine oclock I have.
