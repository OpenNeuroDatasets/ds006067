9.36	9.11	So, today, I am here to do this MRI scan.
19.15	2.82	It's been a really long time since I had an MRI.
22.45	0.82	Not that long.
23.61	2.16	I had one maybe three years ago.
28.83	6.82	But back then, it was because I had a potential brain tumor, but thank goodness that was not true.
36.97	7.01	That reminds me, I spent a lot of time at the hospital during COVID because of this potential brain tumor.
44.01	2.94	We weren't sure what the mass was in my brain, but it turned out to be fine.
46.98	4.09	It was just a regular brain mass.
52.43	3.24	That reminds me of my mom, actually.
55.97	14.4	During COVID, at the hospital, you can only spend one or you can only have one person come into your room with you, and that same person has to be the one that comes in every single time.
70.4	1.21	You can't change the person.
73.39	5.74	Apparently, my mom and dad literally went to war about who would be the person, and my mom won.
79.67	4.6	So, I spent a lot of time with my mom at the hospital during COVID.
84.87	8.76	Surprisingly, no one in my family actually contracted COVID during the entire pandemic, even though I was in the hospital for a very long time.
95.63	12.38	That came as a surprise to all of us and also the hospital staff because, actually, our nurses had contracted COVID twice during the whole thing.
108.41	1.22	So, that was interesting.
110.41	7.54	Right now, I feel a little nervous, but that's normal.
118.95	2.52	I'm a nervous type of person.
125.19	2.76	I'm reminded of how loud the MRI machine is.
127.98	8.11	I don't recall it being this loud when I was getting my MRI three years ago, but I guess it is this loud.
136.97	10.76	After this is over, I'm probably going to go home and FaceTime my mom to tell her about this whole experience.
148.49	6.44	And then she will probably remind me that it's probably very normal and that that was probably what happened three years ago.
154.95	2.8	I just don't remember correctly.
158.67	4.38	And then I will most likely make lunch at home.
163.29	2.23	I was supposed to have lunch with a friend today,
165.58	2.43	but she had an emergency and had to go down home.
168.97	1.72	So, we will not be having lunch together.
170.91	2.56	And then tomorrow is Saturday.
174.19	4.3	Surprise, I have my cousins coming over from Australia.
179.15	1.98	They will be staying for only one day.
181.17	7.22	They're actually in the United States for a tour, and they're near the DC region and they have two days of leisure time.
188.49	3.7	So, they decided to rent a car and come visit me.
194.41	1.54	But I'm not really sure what we're going to do for just a day.
196.95	2.58	There's not a lot to do in Baltimore, actually.
201.37	2.76	The last time they were over, we already went to DC.
204.16	4.31	And they're here on a tour, so they already probably visited DC a lot.
210.35	3.56	So, maybe we'll go to Fells Point, I'm not really sure.
217.47	12.62	I also realized just now that I have a Stat assignment due on Sunday that I haven't even started.
230.35	4.3	Now that I think about it, that's a little worrisome, but I think I'll be okay.
235.21	2.5	It's just a draft.
239.87	10.0	Oh, tonight, I have to email some of my professors to let them know that I might be missing class next week for some interviews.
252.19	2.12	I'm really nervous about these interviews, actually.
254.33	6.72	I've been getting so many rejections from internships that I'm no longer sure if I'm capable of getting one.
261.51	2.36	But hopefully, that turns out fine.
268.29	2.54	This noise is louder than I thought it would be.
274.15	9.1	When the semester is over, I am actually planning a trip to my home country.
284.97	13.36	But I'm not sure what the logistics are yet, because the tickets to Korea have been so expensive that I have been scared to swipe my card and buy the tickets.
299.73	11.32	Hopefully though, I heard that two weeks before, sometimes they'll drop the prices suddenly because they have to sell out all the tickets.
311.51	7.92	So, I'm putting my risk into all of this, I'm waiting for two weeks before I decide to go.
321.71	3.73	Which is kind of disconcerting because I actually have finals during that time.
325.71	1.46	But hopefully, it'll work out.
328.57	6.48	Speaking of finals, I have finals all the way up to the last day of finals period…
335.08	5.32	…which is really annoying because I usually like to go home early.
340.89	3.2	But, I mean, I don't really have a choice, do I?
346.21	4.08	I also have a midterm coming up, actually, this Thursday.
350.93	8.16	It's for a class that's a little bit more business-like or like a business class, which is really cool because I've never taken a business class before.
359.63	1.95	And I'm actually really enjoying it.
362.05	5.02	And surprisingly, it's actually my highest score or my highest grade so far this semester.
369.23	3.56	So, it came as a surprise to me because I really thought I was a STEM-based person.
372.86	4.75	But apparently, I'm much more Humanities than I thought I was.
379.25	6.36	I told my mom about this and she was also very shocked and surprised because she also thought that I was a STEM-based person.
386.23	7.06	Especially because my dad is a chemist, and my mom, she studied social sciences.
393.81	12.94	Everyone thought that science was the strong point for everyone in our family, but we're realizing really quickly that we're a really good mix of science and humanities.
406.87	4.84	Also, my sister, because my sister hates science.
412.41	9.44	Speaking of hating science, I actually hate chemistry, which is something that my dad has a PhD in and he does not understand.
422.31	8.88	He has been criticizing me and my sister for not liking chemistry, but I don't know.
431.71	3.56	I guess those kinds of things don't get passed down in your genetics…
437.27	5.86	…because I simply do not find chemistry as easy as my dad makes it seem like it is.
444.73	7.79	Also, maybe it's just that my dad doesn't explain things as well because he has a PhD and he already has all the information in his head, so he simplifies it.
455.3	4.61	But either way, chemistry is not my top subject.
460.27	2.06	Speaking of chemistry, that reminds me.
463.09	6.16	I took a biochemistry course outside of Hopkins, actually, and then I had to retake it at Hopkins.
469.71	8.64	And I remember complaining to my mom that it's the same course, but it's 10 times more difficult at Hopkins.
478.97	2.98	Yes, that was a really interesting experience for me.
483.95	15.6	I had assumed that all of the classes would -- across different universities -- be of similar density of material, but I proved myself very wrong.
499.97	14.32	I actually had to retake the course at Hopkins, because at that time, I was a pre-med and transfer credits were not -- how do I say it? -- appreciated for pre-med at that time.
514.51	8.2	So, I was advised by my pre-med adviser and also my academic adviser to just take it again at Hopkins because I had some credit left anyways.
522.97	6.32	So I did, and I totally regretted it because it was way too hard.
529.47	21.4	The class itself, everyone was so smart that I felt like I was behind them, but that was a totally different experience from what I had experienced when I took the biochemistry course at Duke that one summer.
551.45	9.67	Speaking of Duke, I was actually at Duke that summer because my sister is a fencer, so she had a fencing thing at Duke.
561.85	5.84	Like a fencing camp/tournament thing, which was really cool.
567.97	14.34	So, I was actually at Duke with my sister as her guardian, because at that time, my dad was on a really long business trip and my mom was unable to leave work at that time.
582.97	8.6	"So, I was there as her guardian during the summer and I decided, ""You know what, I don't want to just sit here and do nothing."""
591.67	4.24	So, I took a bunch of courses and one of them was biochemistry.
