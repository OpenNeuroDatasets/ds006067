5.41	13.24	Okay I'm thinking about the uh elementary school, when someone says can I go to the bathroom and the teacher says uh I don't know can you?
19.29	5.43	It's how I felt when I started reading the, reading the powerpoint.
26.64	2.07	I'm thinking about how lovely this noise is.
29.77	7.64	And how it blocks the sound of the other thing that I thought was my heartbeat.
37.56	6.34	I know it's not my heartbeat but that's what I was thinking about.
45.23	11.64	Um, thinking about um the song that we heard in the uber, or the lyft, and how I really like the first cardi B song that was playing.
58.95	4.23	But how I had to held my enthusiasm about the song in.
68.31	2.9	Um, I'm thinking about football, not soccer.
74.07	1.3	Now I am thinking about the soccer game that was playing beforehand.
76.75	2.05	And what the odds were on the game.
80.53	4.69	I'm thinking about New Jersey, my parents, their house.
86.87	1.53	And now my friends in New Jersey.
90.02	5.8	And an argument that I never had but think about a lot
97.41	7.07	I’m thinking about my girlfriend now and how uh she wanted to be here.
105.63	1.79	Or she would like to do this experiment.
109.01	11.66	Um im thinking about what the experiment is and how talking aloud feels slightly different than whats actually going on in my head.
121.92	5.49	And then as soon as it comes out of my mouth that it disappears in my head
128.52	7.87	and now im thinking about a short poem that I had written about this.
136.58	13.01	Oh no im thinking about why uh putting things on paper makes them uh easier to grasp.
151.09	6.03	And therefore they go out of your head and that could have been said more eloquently.
158.76	12.78	I'm thinking about the heart rate monitor and when people they use it for exercise, and now im thinking about fitbits.
173.15	3.37	And the noise is great.
178.03	5.59	And now I'm remembering savannah told me not to talk about the scanner the whole time.
184.97	8.52	Um now I'm laughing on the inside about how you guys can't hear the noise that I'm just complaining about it.
196.88	4.43	Now I'm thinking about uh how I haven't blinked in a while.
202.58	8.24	And now I'm thinking about the, I don't know the psych I'm forgetting the psych term well I need the thing that is staring to fade away if you haven't moved your eyes in a while.
211.54	5.07	Ugh now i'm thinking about chaz because I did his intro TA class and we talked about that.
217.68	5.81	Uh well now I feel like my eyes are starting to blur.
224.8	12.34	Um im thinking about whether my mouth is getting drier and drier and now im thinking about my bottle that I should have brought.
238.09	4.04	I'm thinking about my run this morning
243.53	11.87	and I'm thinking about this being a like the weirdest form of therapy that could ever exist where, yea.
255.66	8.14	And I feel like people would pay premium for this because its new and weird but I don't think it would work well.
266.01	22.6	I’m thinking about mitch hedberg popped into my head, um, and I'm thinking about radyburg astlifk at netflix and loki, and synth music, and, uh, the dentist,
289.83	8.56	and now I'm trying to think about what it would be like sitting outside this room?
299.46	15.99	I'm just imagining the uh parts of the hospital and motor movements, and how I think about motor movements a lot, and they’re impossible to describe,
316.81	3.5	and I was thinking about my my meeting with my advisor this morning
321.67	1.55	And deciding whether it went well or not,
324.72	13.55	and the work im gonna do tonight, and dessert and cookies, and, um, oh, woop,
338.82	11.49	now i'm thinking about ping pong balls in my eyes, and how you can hallucinate if you put ping pong balls in your eyes, and that is something i've talked about with my advisor, and I need to try that.
351.96	12.09	And, oh, now im thinking about the stand-up comedy thing I did in new york, and how this feels eerily similar to that because I bombed.
365.44	5.58	And I was just talking, and yeah, no one laughed.
371.34	1.62	And the bright, the lights were bright.
373.88	1.92	Now I'm thinking about my friend that I did that with
376.97	5.84	And I'm thinking about it would have been better if people, if it was as barn and people have been drinking.
386.44	3.56	Now i'm kind of wondering how long 10 minutes was
391.19	3.2	And I just feel like I just moved my head so im sorry.
396.37	6.02	Um now I'm thinking about how my voice sounds different when it's recorded
403.38	3.74	And then there's the whole thing about I moved.
408.07	8.31	Um how you're, the bones in your head vibrate when something when it makes more bass sounding.
417.49	3.42	And i'm thinking about my undergrad, I think where I learned that maybe.
421.86	11.1	And now a friend that I had in my undergrad who I haven't talked and where that friend is now located and that person's job.
433.7	28.93	I'm thinking about Boston where I hung out with them and my apartment and the bar hop and scotch and I'm thinking about another friend that I lived with and contacting them and a text message that I haven't replied to and I'm thinking about another friend.
463.05	1.47	Now I'm thinking about golf.
465.96	3.23	I uh don't even have video games.
469.19	3.01	I'm thinking about breakfast.
472.2	3.28	And eggs,
477.3	4.82	and this fixation point.
483.3	8.73	And now I've been staring at it and i'm wondering whether there is, if it's even still in powerpoint but im still fixated not even looking away.
492.93	12.26	Now I'm thinking about powerpoint and presentations and a funny conversation I had about powerpoint, um
507.54	3.37	now i'm thinking about skiing.
511.96	6.09	And how this these this thing that I'm looking through kinda feels like ski goggles.
518.92	3.07	My ski goggles broke, or I scratched them up so much.
524.29	4.29	That I couldn't see in them and it was really, really really cold.
530.68	1.01	Really cold.
532.96	0.75	Went down fast.
535.63	1.2	One kid chickened out.
536.83	8.58	Um, I'm thinking about a girlfriends friend we met.
547.34	1.63	I'm thinking about this weekend.
550.26	9.07	Now i'm thinking about the air condition that I'm feeling on my arms right now and how it's really nice and cold and outside it's so hot.
560.1	1.64	And the opposite of cold.
562.77	0.71	Now I'm thinking about the shirt I'm wearing.
565.7	0.88	And it's red.
568.76	12.13	And now I'm wondering whether people think about some other things than I am thinking about.
583.76	5.56	And that right there in my head sounded like something Justin would say.
591.45	10.0	And now I’m remembering I should have asked whether all my talkings were anonymous and now I'm thinking about the westworld episode.
