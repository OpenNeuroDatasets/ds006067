1.96	4.34	It's really cold, and I don't like that beeping noise.
7.5	1.89	But, I guess that's why I have the blanket on.
10.07	0.51	It's kind of comfy.
12.34	3.06	Oh, wow, that beeping is really loud.
15.6	2.36	Okay, that's why the earplugs are in.
21.86	1.77	It's not too uncomfy.
24.49	6.11	The mic is pretty close, and it is kind of dropping, I think.
32.08	0.94	But, it's fine.
33.56	0.72	I can deal with it.
36.72	6.0	I guess I'm not really a fan of the earplugs.
43.98	1.1	But, it's okay.
45.08	0.68	We can deal with it.
46.57	1.05	One hour.
49.92	2.69	I woke up this morning, felt pretty good.
53.01	0.77	Got a lot of sleep.
54.16	2.42	Yesterday was really tiring.
59.72	4.18	I'm surprised I can even hear myself with the earplugs and the beeping.
67.94	6.98	When I got put in and told to close my eyes, I felt like I was going through some sort of vacuum tunnel.
76.5	4.46	And, I was getting shot in, and then being flipped upside down.
80.98	8.0	And then, when I saw through the mirror, or through the lens, I was like, how am I upside down when she's still upright?
89.22	1.8	And then I realized I'm still upright.
91.56	2.24	So, I'm wondering how this mirror thing works.
98.52	0.75	I'm really tired.
99.73	0.77	I'm really tired.
101.49	3.39	But, I don't think I can fall asleep with this beeping, so that's probably good.
109.3	7.56	Yesterday, the women and men basketball teams, they played their conference, their first conference game.
118.7	0.88	And they won both.
120.26	2.4	And they're very emotional.
124.44	4.44	And it was so cool to see how invested they were.
129.02	3.04	And it was like making me feel like I was part of them.
132.18	1.0	Because I was just working the game.
133.18	0.96	So, I was on the baseline.
134.72	4.31	And I saw a bunch of people come out and show up to support.
139.57	1.07	That was awesome to see.
146.04	0.7	And I don't know.
146.74	6.74	I saw the women, they started to pull away, and they were getting super vocal about it.
153.52	5.21	And I was just like, my heart was starting to be super passionate about the game.
158.73	0.62	I don't know why.
159.35	3.53	Maybe it was because I worked most of the basketball games.
164.3	4.5	And then the men, they were just, Wawa showed up.
169.16	3.84	And they were pretty funny with their comments and stuff.
173.0	1.4	And I was laughing the entire time.
174.4	0.55	I was happy.
175.63	1.19	It was a good time.
178.62	1.9	But then I was just so tired.
182.46	5.34	I had been near that area of campus for 10 hours on end.
190.72	9.1	And I walked home, and by the middle of the women's game, my eyes were like, I was barely able to keep my eyes open.
201.6	6.02	And it was just, I was like, I could barely make it through the men's game.
209.32	3.6	But just the crowd and the loudness, and the excitement of being there.
214.72	1.96	I think that just kept my eyes open.
216.68	1.98	I was able to keep my eyes open like that.
220.64	6.06	I was out from 12 to 10 just at the rec, or at my, I was just so miserable.
228.62	5.06	But then after, I had some golden Oreos, kind of a dub.
235.2	1.7	And then I just crashed right after that.
238.72	10.78	And then this morning, I woke up, and I was at the bus, or I was at the bus stop until like 9:32.
251.66	1.7	And buses usually come at 9.30.
253.36	2.26	This is my first time going, taking the JHMI shuttle.
255.62	10.24	I've been on all the other, or I've been on some of the other Hopkins shuttles, but this is my first time going down to JHMI.
268.68	1.1	Kind of an experience.
270.88	2.94	Also, Thursday was such a nice day.
273.82	0.82	It was so warm.
274.98	2.5	Okay, my lip keeps touching the mic.
278.82	1.96	But Thursday was such a nice day.
284.18	4.96	I think I even was able to sleep in, so I slept in until like 10.30, 11ish.
289.8	2.75	Where weather, it was still kind of cold.
292.55	0.86	It was like 55.
293.41	0.65	Cold for the day.
294.72	10.22	But 55, and I slept in, went to lunch, brunch-ish.
305.92	3.48	And then that's when it started getting warm around 1 or 2.
310.94	3.76	And I was in the library for a bit, but then I was like, it's such a nice day, like I can't waste it.
314.74	7.12	So, I went outside, and everyone had the same idea, which I'm so happy for, because it felt like an actual spring day.
322.22	2.24	There's so many people on the beach, just chilling.
326.04	7.5	And so many of my friends were there, so instead of just doing work outside, I kind of got distracted for like two, three hours.
336.26	1.64	But, that's probably for the better.
337.9	2.36	Just enjoying the sun with friends instead of doing work.
340.7	1.9	And I skipped both my classes, so I could do that.
343.98	5.26	But yeah, I only had classes in the afternoon on Thursday.
353.7	2.57	And then it's such a nice day.
356.72	1.22	I wish every day was like that.
359.36	0.84	Reminded me of home.
362.08	7.0	That's what every day, from probably about now, until like April is like that.
369.72	4.58	Just nice, warm, sunny, constant 70s, shorts weather.
374.96	4.34	Not even like cold mornings, cold evenings too, like this one was.
381.66	3.24	But like 70 the entire day, and it's just so nice.
386.1	7.88	But the only problem with that is allergies are coming back, and I think my allergies are starting to come back.
394.0	1.52	I'm like getting super sniffly.
397.12	4.76	And with the temperature change, I get hella nosebleeds.
402.9	4.68	Like yesterday in the middle of the game I was working, I just randomly got a nosebleed.
407.58	2.73	Had to run to the bathroom, get that sorted out.
410.95	0.79	It sucks.
416.66	0.91	It's beeping.
418.02	1.66	It's, oh, my God.
422.72	2.38	This chest strap is kind of tight, but not too tight.
425.36	1.16	It's not uncomfortable.
426.82	1.04	But I did notice it.
429.17	1.13	I think it's for the heart rate.
431.12	1.72	Just measuring heart rate.
436.48	0.95	It's not as cold.
437.43	2.77	I was able to pick up the blanket, cover my arms.
442.38	4.28	Thank God I asked for that, because I think I would have been cold and shivering if I didn't.
449.4	3.92	And yeah, the mic has been getting lower and lower.
454.32	1.25	It looks like a toothbrush.
457.11	1.43	With the bristles on the other end.
463.86	3.72	Now I'm wondering if this beeping, is it going for everything, or just...?
468.24	1.07	Just to think about it.
469.31	1.19	Hopefully, it's just to think about it.
472.88	3.24	Every time I swallow, I can feel the earbuds moving.
477.1	5.56	It's kind of cool that ENT are all connected.
485.8	6.8	I did hear that ENT is probably the worst field to specialize in.
492.64	5.1	If you want to be an adult care doctor, just because it's the same thing over and over again.
498.02	2.06	It's so boring.
502.72	6.32	And also, you're not supposed to use Q-tips to clean your ears.
509.74	2.1	Because the cotton can get stuck.
511.92	5.26	I saw a video of some girl who used a Q-tip and had a really bad experience.
518.36	4.12	The entire bulb got stuck in her ear.
523.4	2.37	So, once you pulled it out, there was nothing.
526.32	3.94	There was one bulb on one end and the other was missing half of it.
530.72	1.27	That's pretty scary, I feel like.
533.12	3.4	That's probably a good video to advertise not using Q-tips.
539.94	2.58	I think the mic just got lower.
543.28	3.02	I was only touching it on some words that I have to pronounce.
546.96	0.81	Or some letters.
547.77	1.84	And now it's more and more.
550.56	0.72	M, for sure.
552.24	13.05	L, A, B, D, C, B, C, D, E, F, G, B, G, H,H, I, J, J is another one.
565.7	14.65	K, joy, Jerry, K, L, M, Mary, Market.
582.21	7.75	M, N, O, O, P, there's Q.
591.26	0.88	I just feel like it's on.
592.14	3.04	I don't even know if I see them letters.
598.52	4.6	I'm going to do a lab report.
