3.09	6.0	I was just thinking of how, umm, yesterday I was talking to a friend.
9.34	4.96	I haven't, I haven't seen my friend in... I haven't talked to my friend in a very long time.
15.23	1.88	Uh, and it was just good to catch up.
18.17	11.44	She moved to a different country and we haven't really talked much since, since she did so but I'm glad that she is adjusting pretty well and that, uh, she's doing well in general.
30.31	9.39	Umm, and then, umm, I was also thinking of how, I've had a a lot of friends in recent years that have, you know, just moved on with their lives.
39.72	4.44	It's pretty interesting that everyone is kind of doing their own little thing.
45.15	6.97	Some of them are going back to school, some of them are, umm, just, uh, you know, raising family.
52.68	13.02	Some of them are still in school like me, but it's pretty interesting to see how, how everyone has just, you know, done, done different things and, uh, starting to search for their own little path.
66.41	19.92	Umm, and how, umm, also so thinking that, umm, you know, my family back in Cuba, my sister mainly, she, she really... Uh, like how, you know, everyone, umm, of my family is here and then my sister is still in Cuba
86.34	1.08	and so soon I'll come back.
87.84	6.9	Oh, soon I come here to, to the US but it's hard to find work, to find to, to find a job here for her to do so.
94.97	2.38	Uh, you know, she's, she's definitely working on that.
99.3	10.45	Umm, also thinking of finals and studying for finals and preparing for the finals and how I have a lot of things to do.
110.3	6.35	Uh, and at, at the same time, like my own research projects and grading for the class that I'm doing for.
117.18	7.83	And it's a little bit of a lot and sometimes, you know, you get overwhelmed, but you just have to keep on moving forward and keep on working hard.
125.82	6.95	Keep on, uh, just keep on, keep on doing stuff that you have to do like the semester is almost over, the year's almost over.
133.34	7.23	And once it's done then, umm, we can, I mean, then I can finally, you know, take some time off and relax.
141.01	5.36	Umm, my parents are, are back in Memphis.
146.41	3.87	I have to go visit them this... Umm, by the end of the year.
150.5	2.29	Basically, uh, wanted to go and, but I don't know.
154.53	4.36	Probably next week I'm, I'm flying there to visit them, spend a week or so with them.
158.93	0.53	It's gonna be fun.
159.52	0.9	It's gonna be great to see them.
161.21	7.17	Uh, so they haven't seen them since the summer and they wanted to come for, uh, thanksgiving, but they couldn't.
169.21	2.23	So it's gonna be great to just spend some time with them.
172.2	3.58	Umm, my mom is not doing great in terms of health,
175.9	2.4	so, uh, I know she's gonna be happy to see me.
178.97	14.24	Umm, she does need to take some time off so hopefully she can get a couple days off of work and we can, uh, relax and she can also feel a little bit better, umm, health-wise because, because I'm pretty sure that, that she's, she's gonna, she's gonna need a couple days off.
193.98	12.78	Umm, I wanted to go with her to visit her family in Texas also, uh, as, as... Uh, we'll also probably again get a couple days to go and, uh, drive off and, and see her family back in Texas.
207.41	3.11	Umm, it's gonna be pretty, pretty fun to do as well.
211.62	1.84	Just, yeah, spend some time with them.
214.06	9.29	And I have to come back next year, I have a lot of plans for early next year that I really wanna, wanna finish, uh, soon, mainly for my research.
224.22	5.73	Umm, also have to decide what I'm gonna TA, so I also have to start worrying about that.
230.6	13.25	I have to talk to my professor to see what courses, uh, he, he recommends 'cause there aren't really that many that are into my area and, uh, that's gonna be also a plan for before the end of the year.
243.9	13.86	But yeah, for, for next year to have to work with a lot of my research 'cause I'm finally gonna be done with classes and I can dedicate my most basically that and I'm gonna spend my time with that, and then actually not I'm able to spend my time because I have to TA.
258.31	11.29	So that's also something else I have to worry about but I do really wanna finish this project and uh, probably something really is gonna, is gonna be exciting.
270.45	1.63	Let's see how that, how that goes.
272.73	8.35	I really also wanna go get back to playing soccer because I haven't played soccer since, I wanna say, I would say over a month.
281.82	2.32	Uh, I used to play basically a couple times a week.
284.98	2.38	And that is, that was something that was very fun.
287.39	8.06	Even though now it's very cold, uh, I can always play, there's always gonna be games because we, we usually don't really care about the weather.
296.04	9.1	So it's gonna be very interesting to see, umm, my old, my old soccer friends and, uh, go and catch up and, you know, spend some time with them.
305.59	0.69	It's also very fun.
307.21	21.36	Umm... Also about sports, umm, my... I finally fixed my bike, so even though it's a little bit cold and it's raining, hopefully once it stop raining, the weather, it's a little bit decent I can start also going for longer bike rides now that I fixed my bike because, umm,
328.94	4.41	I missed a couple of months just fixing my bike and working on that and making sure that it was in proper condition.
334.17	14.98	And now that it is finally in proper condition I can, I can just, uh, you know, go ahead and explore a little bit more the city as well, which was why I wanted to get a bike but then, I started fixing it and haven't really been able to do a lot of that, umm.
353.55	7.0	Ooh, today, to have to... To have to go and, uh, run a couple errands after this.
361.47	15.94	Uh, mainly because, uh, I'm having a couple friends over, over the weekend, so I'm trying to like, trying to fix, uh, and prepare all the stuff that I have to do school-wise so that on Sunday, I can hang out with my friends 'cause it's gonna be for the World Cup final.
377.91	8.94	That should be a lot of fun, uh, watching the World Cup with my friends and, uh, stuff, even though I'm still in finals, so I have to worry about that first.
387.57	6.62	But, yeah, Sunday's gonna be... You have to spare a couple hours just dedicated to that and, uh, and, and enjoy that.
394.85	8.18	And it's funny because even though my team is not gonna win, 'cause they already got eliminated, I do really like the teams that are still on, so it's gonna be exciting.
403.06	3.55	It's gonna be fun to have them over and, uh, and view the World Cup.
412.05	14.1	And then, also, umm, I'm excited for the World Cup to be over because then club soccer can come back, and, uh, I can finally watch my team play again, which they were doing really good before the World Cup.
426.28	5.89	So let's see if we can carry the form and, uh, and see that.
435.21	12.95	Randomly, going back to my friends, uh, I started catching up with a few friends from, from back in the day, mainly because they finally... Uh, we just have moved from Cuba to somewhere in the States.
448.71	2.97	Uh, and, and I have to catch up with them.
452.15	3.01	I haven't really talked to them in a couple of years or so.
455.59	11.1	Uh, so it's... So it's good to, you know, catch up and, uh, see if we can organize like a little, uh, thing to meet somewhere and, uh, and just like meet again because we haven't hung out in a few years.
466.71	4.17	I haven't... I wasn't able to go back to Cuba since 2019.
471.53	8.83	And now that they're here, it's gonna be, hopefully, easier to meet, even though they're basically farther, uh, farther away than they were, when they were back in Cuba, so that's interesting.
482.19	5.38	Umm, but yeah, I have friends in Kentucky, I have friends in Florida, and friends in a couple other cities around.
487.72	9.19	So our initial plan was to go to Miami or something and... Uh, 'cause most of them are over there, so just hang out with them and, and catch up.
496.93	5.01	That's gonna be very, very fun for the... If I... If we... If we actually end up... End up doing that at some point.
506.1	4.93	Also have a friend that is moving to, to New Jersey.
511.32	2.15	Uh, we didn't with... We, we went to high school together.
513.96	1.9	We thought we'd just as soon move in somewhere close.
516.45	4.1	Cause, uh, for... Uh, from high school, she went to, umm, Georgia.
520.98	0.85	I wasn't busy.
522.07	4.09	Then I came to Maryland, and she moved to Texas.
526.7	1.67	So now, she's gonna move to New Jersey.
528.76	13.8	She's gonna be very close by and we can finally catch up and hang out and, uh, do a couple of stuff together 'cause we used to be very, very close friends and now, well, now we're kind of like, you know, farther away and stuff.
542.72	2.66	But it should be... It should be a lot of fun.
545.53	10.59	I do... I did tell her that I was gonna help her move in so whenever that happens, I have to, I have to go to Jersey and, umm, and help her, but that's gonna be fun.
556.47	5.5	She'll be, she'll be great to have around or, I mean, just closer in general than when she was away.
565.47	4.45	I also have a friend that recently moved to Maryland kinda far, very close to DC.
570.79	8.3	But, uh, I haven't been able to make time to go visit him, and I do have to do it because we used to be very close friends back in... Back in high school.
579.56	4.01	Uh, and, uh, I have to make a time and go, and go check on him.
584.32	9.24	Uh, he's, he's sort of like a senior to me because he worked in the same science team, and he was a senior and I was a, a freshman.
593.59	3.01	So, uh, should be... He was a pretty cool person.
596.85	0.57	Pretty smart too.
598.11	5.42	Umm, hopefully we can... I can make some time probably...soâ€¦that was a lot.
