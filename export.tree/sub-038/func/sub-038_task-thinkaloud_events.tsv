8.84	3.57	Um, okay, I'm thinking about how this machine is kind of annoying.
12.42	6.22	It makes a lot of weird sounds, and it kind of sounds like a light saber or something from Star Wars, which I don't particularly enjoy.
19.42	4.3	I feel like they should make them more pleasant and have nicer sounds.
23.96	5.97	They had a lot of nice sounds when I was in Singapore, and the bus made a lot of fun sounds, which I enjoy.
30.65	3.91	Um, I kinda wish I could go back to Southeast Asia.
34.83	4.39	I really liked the food, especially in Vietnam, that was really good.
39.74	2.94	Um, this kinda makes me nervous.
42.84	5.82	I feel like I'm gonna likely... You guys are gonna find something in my brain or something weird, I don't know.
49.78	6.89	Um, and I'm thinking about how I did this, because Ben asked me to, and I've known Ben since freshman year, super nice.
57.72	4.54	Um and Dhruva did this talk thing too and she didn't find anything.
62.43	7.17	She... I think she said that she talked about, the friend group and like other people, which makes sense 'cause Dhruva does like gossip, which is strange she's mol cell.
72.48	2.25	I don't really know what to talk about for 10 minutes.
75.41	1.31	There's a lot of, like, random stuff.
77.81	6.12	Um, but yeah, I'm thinking about school right now, especially, like, lab.
84.13	1.21	I don't really know what we're doing right now.
85.69	2.1	My boss is kind of all over the place.
88.66	13.33	Uh, Steve didn't show up today, so I... That meant that I had to go in and do like a lot of the mice work and prepare the DSS, which I'm not really sure what trajectory he's taking with this experiment, but I guess it is what it is.
102.33	3.52	Because I only have, like, a year left, and I still have to figure out what I wanna do for my gap year.
107.93	16.79	Um, not sure I can really afford to go to Peru, even though it's what I wanna do, but I guess there's a lot going on in other places, and I should really look for jobs at some point, but it feels kind of overwhelming, so I keep putting it off and I keep procrastinating, but at least I'll figure something out, probably.
125.35	9.39	And I need to figure out if I'm getting paid for that, because I need to make money, because I don't have any money, and I like to order out food, so I kind of need to make the money for that.
136.12	10.31	Um, not really sure long-term what I wanna do, because I keep changing it, but I should probably figure out the gap year, because it's coming up much sooner than I'd like to.
146.91	2.52	But I'm really excited to go to Peru in January.
150.07	7.76	I hope I can get some good coffee, and I hope I actually have time to explore the country outside of just, like, doing the work during the day.
158.3	2.1	And I kinda don't even know what I'm supposed to do for the study.
160.74	5.59	As far as I know all I'm doing is flights, we should probably ask Dr. [0:03:04.1] ____ about that.
166.85	5.08	And figure out what other parts are paid, if I should be saving up right now, or what I'm gonna be doing actually, like, in the study.
172.58	7.97	I know he told me a couple weeks ago that I'm supposed to be meeting up with the Peruvian team, but I'm kinda worried that my Spanish won't be good enough to actually live there for two weeks.
180.93	4.96	Even though it is only two weeks, and that's, like, as long as I went to Singapore and Vietnam and I was fine there.
185.93	7.73	But I feel like I should be practicing my Spanish, but I don't really know where to find the time to do that, or if I should be reading or talking to people.
195.08	4.35	But I should probably figure out if, like, other parts of that trip are paid for or not.
199.96	13.75	I'm not really sure who I'm meeting, or, like, anything really beyond the flights, and I'm really glad they fixed that, because the flight was supposed to be, like, no gap, no, like, layover in between going from Atlanta to Peru, which really stressed me out.
213.93	8.78	And Will said that there wasn't a great layover time anyways, and that also that Atlanta's airport is, like, insane, so I'm glad that, that got fixed.
222.91	7.02	Now I have two hours, so that should give me plenty of time to, like, settle down and chill and, like, get food or whatever I need to do before actually arriving.
230.51	4.65	And I really hope that somebody meets me at the airport, because that would make me pretty nervous to, like, try and figure that out.
235.18	1.92	Even though I did it in Singapore, so I should be fine.
237.76	3.42	It's just everything's scary when it's new, I guess, I don't really know.
241.93	7.5	And then I hope that I actually have a place to stay and that they have figured out the accommodations for me, because that would be kind of last minute, and that would kind of suck.
249.78	2.85	So I should probably ask them that at this meeting on Thursday.
253.93	10.71	Which Thursday's gonna be a really busy day, I've had so many meetings, and I feel bad the clinic isn't really picking up, but I feel like there's no point in going in if there's nothing really going on.
264.73	1.18	Especially after Jenny left.
266.03	5.68	And it's good that Jenny left, because she was kind of terrorizing everybody, and that's fine, I guess.
271.83	9.5	But I feel like the clinic will run smoother without her in the long term, but I think what she did was kind of made it way more difficult for everybody.
281.37	9.12	Because now they don't have anybody to work the front desk, which means that the patients won't be getting the same level of care, which is disappointing, because they don't already get care, so I'm not really sure what they're going to do about that.
290.54	13.01	I think Ellen will probably step in at the front desk, which is good, but I feel like I could just work from home for the most part on Thursdays, because I don't like have anything to do anymore with the referrals department being kind of shut down.
304.01	3.85	With Kari taking her MCAT and everything, I'm really glad that I'm done with the MCAT.
308.25	1.46	That would suck to have to retake that.
310.03	1.2	I kinda miss taking it.
311.93	2.82	I miss the trip to DC though, for the MCAT, the food was so good.
315.33	4.53	I love the rotating sushi bar, I'd like to go back and do that, but maybe I can do that when Will moves to DC.
320.25	7.73	I'd like to see his new apartment, I think it's gonna be really fancy and fun, and like, he's probably, he's probably gonna really enjoy living in DC.
328.4	9.33	I'm not sure I necessarily agree with the job that he took with the defense department, because the defense department, I feel like there's a lot of moral quandaries that come with that, but I guess he got over it, so that's good.
337.98	6.91	And plus I think he took it mainly for the money, which I guess is what people do sometimes, I don't, I don't really know.
344.93	5.69	But I'm a little disappointed that he was actually considering the moral ramifications and then still continued to take the job anyway.
351.01	4.88	But I think it'll be fun to visit him in DC, and I'm kinda glad that he'll be there for the last couple of months.
356.36	5.48	I kinda wonder if I'll be able to live anywhere kinda close to this area for med school, because I kinda like this area.
362.37	6.77	But, uh, med school apps are stressing me out because I don't really know what to say, or what they're gonna ask me or how to make my application sound interesting.
369.42	1.54	And I feel like I'm not a very good interviewer.
371.05	4.78	So, and that's what people always say is like the most important part of the med school process.
378.93	6.02	I hope I can get into, uh, one that has a global surgery program, 'cause I really like what I'm doing with Zach and Alex right now.
385.16	6.34	And I hope this paper gets published, and I'm a little stressed out about the conference in February, because I don't know if I actually have the money to go to the conference.
391.82	6.06	But I really want to go to the conference, because I'm pretty sure this is like the thing that I've been most interested in, in the past four years.
398.09	2.17	'Cause I've changed it up so many times.
400.44	4.89	But that's okay, I really like the public health stuff that I'm doing now, so it's good that I actually figured that out.
405.92	2.43	So that I'm not stuck doing something that I don't like, I guess.
408.6	1.85	But I really wanna go to this conference.
410.55	0.38	It's in Houston.
411.33	3.57	I don't really like Houston, because I don't like Oklahoma, and I feel like they're kinda similar.
414.93	2.5	Plus I've been to Houston before for gymnastics.
417.6	3.64	I'm surprised I haven't had more of these scans done since I was a gymnast for so long.
421.36	1.23	But I probably should, honestly.
422.63	3.84	I should really get my hips and my knees checked out professionally, but that's okay.
427.15	4.52	Knee's fine for now, and I can take the glucosamine supplements, 'cause Ben said that he takes them when he does lifting.
431.79	0.84	He's lifting a lot.
432.9	2.37	I kinda wonder if he's gonna actually compete in the barbell competition.
435.53	1.16	I think he should, he does a lot.
436.87	5.32	And I don't know, I feel like it's kinda weird that he does measure his chickens so much, but I don't know.
442.57	2.59	I think it's cool that he works out so much, and that he's so passionate about it.
445.35	1.08	So it's kind of cool.
446.55	3.98	But he takes the glucosamine supplements for his joints, and I feel like that would be probably helpful.
450.73	2.98	I should probably ask him again about that, and where he gets those supplements.
453.96	3.38	'Cause I feel like that would be pretty helpful, and that way I can keep working out and stuff like that.
457.56	4.84	I'm kinda worried that I'm twitching too much in the machine, I'm not very good at laying still.
465.21	5.13	I feel like I fidget a lot, so I hope I'm not moving too much right now, and that's making me worry.
470.5	4.16	I'm also worried that I'm gonna get like an itch on my face or something and then forget it, and then accidentally scratch my face.
477.21	5.86	I hope I can write this essay on Thursday well enough, I really should start writing it later today, because I don't really know.
483.29	9.49	I think I'm gonna talk about the distribution of healthcare facilities in Peru versus the out-of-pocket expenditures, because I think it's a broader topic and has a greater implication for the population.
492.93	2.62	But I really need to do some research on that.
495.61	2.74	And they said they pushed the paper date back to Wednesday, November 23rd.
498.43	4.28	But that's gonna be during Thanksgiving, and my parents are gonna wannna hang out.
502.89	2.19	And I don't blame them for wanting to hang out, but sometimes there's all.
505.13	2.53	They don't always understand like the school implications.
507.79	1.59	And that's fine, they just had it different.
509.49	7.61	But, I kinda wish they would be more understanding of that, but I should probably start working on the paper this week so that I don't have to stress about it over Thanksgiving.
517.27	3.17	I'm not really looking forward to Thanksgiving.
520.53	4.05	I'm excited to see my parents, and I'm really excited to see Luke, my brother.
524.66	9.94	But, um, I don't know, I, I don't really enjoy going to Oklahoma for Thanksgiving, even though I know they're family and we're supposed to like get along and stuff like that.
534.62	6.5	But Amy is just such a pain, and I know she's gonna cause a lot of stress, especially for my dad which just makes it not so fun.
541.28	5.01	But I also don't really like Oklahoma in general, it's not very pretty, and I don't really like the people very much.
546.44	2.17	But they do have really good food sometimes.
548.74	6.6	I don't really like all the fatty food, but I do wanna go back to the Mexican place that has the Arroz con pollo, that's really good.
555.43	2.29	And they put the cheese sauce all over it, and I really like cheese.
559.26	4.21	I guess I can officially have drinks with my mom now too, so that'll be fun.
563.53	1.52	She'll be really excited to do that.
565.08	2.76	I know she's been looking forward to like more girls days and stuff like that.
568.02	3.81	Plus we get to watch the next... Uh, the next British Baking show, or whatever it is.
571.93	2.18	Great British Baking Show I guess it's called, yeah.
574.32	6.23	I had fun watching that with Dhruva, but I didn't tell her that we'd already watched that episode... That I'd already watched that episode with my mom 'cause she was really enjoying it.
580.76	1.48	I love watching that show.
582.33	3.99	I wish I could try to make more of the stuff from it, I love baking.
586.53	1.43	I wish I had more time for baking.
588.23	3.45	I feel like that would be nice to bake something for Dhruva's little this week.
591.83	4.7	But I don't know if I have the time, and I don't wanna like tell her that I can, and then let her down or anything like that.
596.57	6.7	But I saw those lemon cookies that had the lemon curd on top, and I still have some lemon curd frozen from the last time that I made lemon curd cupcakes.
