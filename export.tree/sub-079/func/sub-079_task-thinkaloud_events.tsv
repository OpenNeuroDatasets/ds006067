2.74	2.41	It is nice today.
7.91	8.67	This week, going out and about, going different places.
17.58	2.44	It's been a cold place.
20.02	2.41	It has been cold and rainy.
23.74	4.63	And I think one of the days I got to crawl in the rain like an hour.
30.86	1.86	And I got rid of the cold.
32.72	2.63	I thought I would get sick from it, but I didn't.
38.39	7.8	One of the buses I was trying to catch was running late, so I had to find a way to get to my destination.
46.19	7.35	So that's how I ended up walking, but eventually I finally got there though.
55.38	2.14	So that was the beginning of my week.
60.91	3.35	The following days, pretty much busy too.
66.66	5.77	Had to run a lot of errands, get a lot things done, important stuff done.
72.43	4.08	So, I was out there all day.
79.5	6.85	And I noticed last few days the weather has changed.
87.38	6.3	Weâ€™re getting warmer, so I decided to wear some cool clothes.
94.9	4.9	Had to layer up too much though, but I just wear enough for not to get sick.
101.21	6.71	So, as it got colder, sunset got colder again.
107.92	8.07	So, I had my coats ready to put on, always carry my stuff with me just in case I may need it.
118.76	3.07	That's how things went this week so far.
124.55	3.68	These afternoons have been pretty restful.
129.13	8.2	By the time I got home, I just laid back, couldn't be sitting to eat because I was hungry.
138.59	1.06	And got ready for bed.
141.21	1.38	But the nights have been restful though.
145.99	6.34	I've been getting some sleep, woke up in the morning, got ready for the day.
155.89	3.46	That's basically how my past few days have been.
160.07	3.12	Days in the morning, laid back afternoons.
165.01	7.74	I woke up in the morning and felt quite refreshed, not as tired as a Sunday would be.
174.19	2.28	So I just got up in the morning to get my day started.
177.43	1.56	To get ready for the day.
180.09	3.48	Got me something to eat and drink in the morning.
185.61	4.84	In the afternoons I get lunch or something to snack on.
193.11	1.84	That's what I've been doing.
197.51	5.36	Today, I'm not sure what we'll be doing today after the study.
204.93	4.32	I'm kind of looking forward to doing the study today.
210.35	4.48	I got something to do this afternoon, so I have to get ready for that.
215.95	3.82	But before that I'm going to have to get something to eat.
222.93	3.2	That's what I got planned.
229.15	2.1	It's been a nice warm day though.
231.93	3.92	A sunny warm day, so I kind of enjoy that.
237.87	2.74	I'm going to wear a lot of coats today, thank goodness.
242.89	2.94	Weather's been a worry though, but I'm glad it's warming up.
247.11	6.2	Sometimes I do prefer a coat, but now that it's raining I don't like to coat without rain.
259.87	4.04	I think March is one of my favorite years, my favorite times of years.
264.21	1.38	March.
266.47	1.14	It's the spring weather.
268.29	1.26	Not too cold, not too hot.
271.75	0.76	It's right in the middle.
273.39	1.76	I'm kind of looking forward to that.
279.87	3.24	I know this time has been flying by.
284.43	4.66	It's the year of 2023.
291.25	4.15	Sometimes I forget, it ain't 2022.
297.17	3.34	I know in January I forget, I still think of it.
300.85	0.86	It's a new year.
306.01	2.0	So I got to remember that.
308.15	2.02	It's 2023.
314.55	3.76	Things are pretty busy for me though.
322.63	0.16	I can't complain though.
323.37	2.54	I like to keep myself busy.
325.99	3.14	I'm mad busy though.
335.77	1.78	Trying to think of things to say right now.
338.45	2.32	Off the top of my head.
342.89	9.96	It's kind of chilly right now, cold right now, but I don't mind the cold.
357.47	1.96	I've been walking everywhere I get to.
359.73	1.6	I do a lot of walking myself.
363.23	2.3	Catch the bus.
369.89	5.86	I like to have it all close so I don't get cold at sunset.
378.91	3.52	Yeah, that's what I do.
386.47	3.36	Trying to think of more things to say.
392.89	5.86	When I'm with a bunch of friends, I like to talk a lot and it don't stop.
400.21	4.86	Even when I'm by myself, I think to myself, but not out loud though.
406.49	2.46	Instead my thoughts just be running through my head.
409.95	1.68	That's what I'm trying to do right now.
417.31	2.39	Yeah, yeah, noises.
421.06	2.05	Inside the machine is beeping noises.
424.61	4.1	Yeah, but that's how the MRI works.
447.15	4.24	I don't know what I got planned for tomorrow or for the holiday.
454.73	1.57	I usually don't make plans.
456.3	1.85	I just go along with the day.
459.73	5.48	Half as half as, I just do things at random.
475.29	1.59	Sometimes I plan things.
478.83	1.52	Things can change.
481.83	2.46	I try to avoid that.
486.07	4.04	I'm the kind of person that just goes along with whatever happens.
497.45	3.14	For the past couple years I've been stuck in the house.
501.15	2.2	During the pandemic, I was not able to leave the house.
504.77	5.6	I was not able to go out, so when I was at home, I didn't do much but clean up.
510.39	1.6	Sleep and eat.
512.89	0.7	That's about it.
515.07	2.3	I did some things on the phone.
517.71	1.82	I surfed the web and things like that.
522.39	1.61	Most of the time I like to be on my phone.
524.49	0.42	Play on my phone.
526.45	2.0	Play games sometimes.
530.61	2.58	I like to keep myself occupied.
535.87	1.54	I don't like to be too bored.
539.33	3.16	Sometimes I can easily get bored without having nothing to do.
543.01	3.4	Or bored, I just fall asleep.
550.25	1.08	I really don't like to take a lot of naps though.
552.31	1.6	To get bored I'm going to sleep at night.
559.07	2.78	I try to maintain a regular sleep schedule.
565.61	3.06	Sometimes when I'm at home I like to do yard work.
570.21	1.78	I like to clean up the house.
572.89	0.84	You know, spot clean.
575.49	1.94	I keep the yard clean.
578.53	6.12	Instead of air time till the ride, things get dirty and messy so I have to go around and clean it up.
592.17	3.88	That's been my life for the past few years.
596.05	1.78	A couple years.
