3.43	0.91	Okay, we're beginning.
5.88	4.22	Wow, I didn't realize thinking out loud would make my heart beat so fast.
10.32	2.09	I wonder why this is so nerve-wracking.
12.84	1.23	I feel like I'm on a spaceship.
15.6	1.65	I don't even know what I'm looking at.
19.76	3.18	I feel like I'm in a hazmat suit.
24.12	0.93	It's really weird.
25.52	6.49	But on the bright side, this is pretty entertaining, so no worries about falling asleep here.
33.14	1.97	I just need to make sure I don't move my head.
37.74	0.56	Problematic.
39.3	6.35	Okay, stay still and not say any personal information.
48.59	1.87	Good thing I wore my contacts.
51.59	1.09	Better eyesight.
53.28	1.88	That TV looks really big.
56.43	1.22	I wonder how this thing works.
60.06	2.63	Why are there scratch marks on this glass?
63.41	1.23	How did that happen?
65.09	1.82	And it's like a magenta.
66.91	2.63	No. Is this magenta?
69.73	0.58	Purple?
70.42	0.62	I don't know.
71.39	0.78	I don't know colors.
72.89	1.5	But some sort of color.
75.2	1.21	I don't know why.
76.79	0.91	I'm just very curious.
80.6	1.22	This is also very distracting.
82.55	0.67	That's all right, that's all right.
83.22	0.46	I've got this.
85.8	1.5	Oh nice, my heartbeat lowered.
87.3	1.25	I don't feel so nervous.
89.13	1.16	Relaxed.
91.21	1.4	A lot of beeping going on around me.
93.34	1.5	It sounds like I'm in a video game.
95.61	0.48	A machine.
96.55	1.55	Like Wreck-It Ralph.
98.1	1.41	What am I even talking about?
102.36	0.82	Fuzzy stuff.
103.95	1.18	Looking at a screen.
105.99	0.99	Thoughts.
107.44	1.41	I'm supposed to have thoughts.
109.44	2.35	Trying to have thoughts is also distracting.
112.79	1.65	What are natural thoughts?
115.21	1.08	Oh wow, that's really fuzzy.
117.32	0.49	What is that?
117.81	0.92	Is that a Velcro?
120.03	2.28	Why is it at the end of this thing?
124.03	0.47	What does it do?
126.43	0.95	It's so confusing.
127.38	1.68	One is white, one is black…
130.15	1.04	…but I don't even know why.
132.01	0.95	Is that the end?
134.62	0.47	What?
135.72	0.87	This is confusing.
137.76	1.19	What are those two things?
138.95	0.34	I don't know.
140.48	3.81	I don't know how this MRI stuff works.
150.02	1.3	What is that?
156.71	0.91	Oh, is it a camera?
157.62	1.41	No. I don't know.
160.43	3.42	I didn't even know they could just set up little TVs that I can look at in an MRI.
163.85	0.6	That's kind of cool.
165.91	1.73	Oh, my lips are touching the mic.
167.64	1.86	I hope I don't eat it.
169.5	0.77	Oh no, I won't.
170.9	0.43	It can't be.
172.61	2.47	I need to stop being so expressive or I'm going to end up moving my face.
175.97	0.81	I shouldn't do that.
176.78	1.23	Less movement.
179.41	0.82	Yes, I can do that.
181.72	1.87	I wonder how long it's been.
184.67	2.05	Man, maybe I should have drank some water.
187.67	1.26	No, then I would have to pee.
188.93	0.69	I should pee.
190.95	1.52	How long do I have to be in here?
195.23	1.51	Relaxing.
198.05	1.08	Got buttons.
201.17	0.95	More beeping.
203.58	0.77	TV.
206.57	3.45	I know I said this before, but that looks pretty big.
210.74	3.0	But I don't think it's actually that big in real life.
213.74	1.08	Maybe it's just this mirror thing…
215.16	1.59	…or whatever this is.
218.0	0.91	Yes, this is a mirror.
219.32	0.72	Yes.
223.64	0.61	Interesting.
225.09	2.01	Anyways, I hope my…
227.75	1.32	Yes, my contacts should be fine.
229.07	1.09	It'll focus.
231.2	0.72	Yes, I can see.
232.38	1.49	Yes, I'm not worried about that.
233.87	0.73	I'm good.
235.64	2.21	I'm just trying to think of thoughts to have…
238.85	2.01	…which I guess is thoughts.
243.08	4.81	Saying my thoughts out loud feels very different than when I'm talking to myself.
249.29	5.22	"Now I'm like, ""Oh, people are going to hear me, they're listening."""
256.1	3.29	"""People are going to know that I don't know how to naturally have thoughts."""
259.39	0.79	Oh dear.
262.58	1.23	I need to stop making noises.
263.81	2.31	That's not normal, right?
266.12	2.58	I don't know.
270.47	0.64	I think other thoughts.
271.31	3.15	Yes, I guess I should say that out loud, huh?
276.96	1.22	Oh no, I'm making noises again.
278.64	0.4	I shouldn't do that.
279.04	1.86	People are going to listen to all the noises I'm making.
283.89	2.4	Now it's just making me think of when I cross streets.
287.38	3.9	When I cross streets, I always make a lot of noises because I'm always jaywalking.
291.61	3.71	And that means I'm always risking getting hit.
295.86	2.13	Unless I'm always screaming internally…
298.45	1.4	…and, well, okay, out loud.
300.31	0.41	Silently.
301.62	3.23	So, unless you're close to me, you're not realizing that I'm screaming as I cross the street.
305.25	0.82	Oh, don't laugh, Christina.
307.2	0.64	Stay still.
309.05	0.73	Still.
309.78	0.91	No movement.
313.58	0.21	Still.
315.03	3.1	Now I'm just thinking about the tennis court.
319.35	3.72	And then I'm thinking about the ice skating rink on the tennis court.
325.84	5.03	Now I'm dictating my thoughts, even though I have no idea why I'm dictating my thoughts.
330.87	5.49	I'm just talking to myself because that's all I can do at the moment.
337.54	2.27	I'm keeping up.
340.17	1.68	Yes, I'm still awake.
342.57	1.94	10 minutes feels longer than I thought…
344.51	4.01	…especially if I just keep talking to myself.
351.69	1.36	And the beeping is still going on.
355.0	6.26	You know, the MRI, the one I did the first time was easier because I fell asleep really quickly.
361.26	2.04	It was a really good nap.
364.39	3.35	I passed out and then I woke up and it was done.
369.33	0.82	But now, I have to stay awake…
371.82	0.96	…which I guess is doable.
373.87	2.9	But a nap, that would have been really good.
376.95	0.91	That would be really nice.
378.81	3.54	I feel like I could take a really good nap in here, if only.
383.8	2.45	I don't think they'd let me take a nap in here after this is done.
390.51	1.68	This really does feel like I'm in a spaceship.
393.01	1.85	Is this what astronauts feel like?
395.49	6.54	They're in a tiny closed space, looking out and seeing some random thing and chilling.
403.71	1.18	I don't know, they're probably not chilling.
411.5	0.55	I wonder.
413.23	5.04	You know, when the earth gets destroyed and we all have to live on Mars, on some spaceship stuff.
418.27	1.52	Why am I talking about some weird things?
419.85	1.0	I should be normal.
422.26	1.13	Normal thoughts.
424.29	1.13	I don't know what people think about.
425.42	1.96	I guess they think about academics.
432.44	1.27	Do I want to think about academics?
435.18	1.25	I don't know.
436.43	0.73	I think I'm doing fine.
437.16	0.36	I'm fine.
438.02	0.72	Forget about that.
438.74	0.91	Let's think about something fun.
439.85	1.57	Oh, food.
442.19	0.91	What am I going to eat today?
450.45	1.13	I'll eat some sweets.
452.85	1.22	Muffin, I have a muffin in my bag.
454.71	1.5	Yes, that's right.
456.42	1.1	Let me eat a muffin.
458.79	1.06	Well, that's not really a real meal, is it? No.
463.03	1.43	I only have sweets.
465.59	2.32	Oh no, I have rice and beans.
469.31	1.2	Am I going to survive this week?
470.55	1.26	Do I have enough food?
476.84	1.27	Should I go grocery shopping?
482.85	3.48	Let's say I'm done, I've got bread.
487.11	1.17	I've got a lot of bread, actually.
490.13	0.36	What else do I have?
490.63	2.96	I have milk that's expiring soon, that I should drink.
494.27	1.13	But I want to make pancakes, so I need eggs.
497.22	1.4	I don't have eggs.
499.26	1.59	It means I should go grocery shopping.
501.66	1.68	Well, I guess I should.
504.2	1.09	And I need meatballs.
505.79	0.91	That seems fairly easy.
507.06	3.36	I have spaghetti that I still need to make.
512.54	1.23	I have got a lot of options.
514.4	2.68	So, I just need eggs, meatballs.
517.47	1.11	What else do I need?
520.89	0.86	Do I need anything else?
522.48	0.95	I really don't think so.
523.43	1.16	I think I can survive.
526.67	4.38	I don't know. Let's see.
532.59	0.77	Oh, granola bars.
534.09	1.22	Fruits. Oh, don't move.
535.31	0.88	Don't be expressive, Christina.
536.85	2.82	Okay, fruits.
540.8	1.63	I wonder which fruits are in season.
543.48	4.62	They always have the strawberries on discount, but last time, they weren't that good.
549.42	1.22	But I want fruits.
552.23	1.81	I wonder if their grapes are any good this time.
554.04	1.95	Their grapes are usually bleh.
558.85	0.68	What else is out there?
560.85	3.47	Mouth is feeling pretty dry.
565.15	2.17	I don't think I really talk this much in natural.
567.95	1.68	This is a long time for talking.
570.85	2.14	Wow, I don't talk a lot, do I?
574.3	0.82	No, I don't think so.
575.57	0.77	It's probably why I'm tired.
577.61	1.77	So much thoughts….
580.01	0.95	…or not enough.
580.96	0.73	I don't know.
583.85	2.33	What was I talking about last time?
588.81	1.64	Oh, that's right, groceries.
591.75	3.77	Yes, I guess I'll just get meatballs.
598.69	0.96	I also need fruits.
599.65	0.7	That's right, fruits.
