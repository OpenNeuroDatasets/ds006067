1.96	1.23	Today was pretty nice.
3.35	3.08	I woke up pretty early to get ready for here.
6.65	2.13	And yeah, weather's been pretty good.
8.87	2.76	A lot better than the last week.
11.69	2.84	It was really cold on Friday and Saturday.
15.24	1.35	That was a pretty fun day.
16.8	3.07	Going out to D.C. to meet up with some friends, going out to the bars.
19.89	0.8	That was a good time.
21.62	1.8	Uh this week so far has been pretty good.
23.62	2.15	Getting through my classes and all that stuff.
26.64	5.45	Today after this I'll go finish up some homework, go to class, probably hit the gym.
32.51	2.12	We'll see how busy it is there.
35.68	2.33	And then do some more homework.
38.07	1.62	Probably hang out with my friends tonight.
40.41	3.0	Tomorrow I've got to go stock up on my fridge.
43.91	1.81	That'll be fun going to Costco.
46.12	3.11	And that'll be a mess, but, oh, well.
49.44	2.23	And then looking forward to next week.
52.19	1.55	Hopefully, I'll find some free time.
54.11	4.75	And then I can go to this convention I want to go to.
58.96	1.77	It'll be about an hour south of here.
61.42	2.26	Um looking forward to that.
63.72	0.9	That'll be a lot of fun.
65.62	2.16	Hopefully, I can meet up with some friends from back home.
68.41	2.91	Maybe some friends that I know will be going out to that.
74.42	3.0	On top of that, I still have to finish up some homework.
78.01	1.82	That's due Saturday.
79.87	2.07	And I'm really not sure how to go with that.
82.0	4.08	But office hours are tomorrow, so hopefully I can talk to the TA.
86.71	0.98	That'll be fine.
89.88	3.04	This clip on my fingertip, it's always there.
92.95	3.3	I can feel that, but I should be used to that at this point.
96.62	7.27	Every time I had to go to surgery or prep for surgery, like getting heart rate, that's always been a weird feeling.
104.18	3.21	But MRIs are pretty cool.
107.65	1.44	Studied them for a little bit.
109.5	4.07	And it's just a giant magnet that's spinning around me, which I think is pretty neat.
117.03	1.58	Baltimore's pretty cool.
118.81	2.59	The Hopkins Hospital is pretty fun.
121.91	2.42	Or not pretty fun, but pretty neat.
124.78	3.79	A bunch of people I know work here or want to go here.
129.22	2.89	I'm looking forward to spring break.
132.81	5.67	Even though it's only the third week of class, but I need it to be spring break.
138.56	2.82	I want to go hang out with my friends in New York City.
142.06	0.79	Go visit them.
143.1	1.32	I haven't seen them in a while.
145.47	3.79	And we'll probably go out and have dinner and drinks and stuff.
149.88	1.2	Go sightseeing again.
152.25	1.04	That'll be a good time.
154.91	1.27	Probably take the Amtrak up.
157.94	1.28	Station is pretty nice.
159.93	5.17	And going up to Penn Station in New York, I want to see the new station.
166.5	2.39	Probably visit some friends in Queens and Brooklyn.
170.06	5.04	That'll be the next big trip before I go home in May, I think.
175.92	3.53	Looking forward to that, because that'll be EDC.
179.94	7.66	And it'll be pretty warm again by that point, so hopefully I'll make it out to Vegas for home.
187.65	5.25	I just got to check on flights, because they're looking pretty expensive before...
195.6	4.04	Before EDC and all that stuff.
200.03	4.11	Because last year it was really, really busy with a bunch of people flying into town.
206.87	1.83	Hopefully, the lineup will be pretty good.
209.52	5.15	I should probably look into buying more concerts and festivals and stuff.
214.75	1.36	Hang out with my friends, then...
216.72	4.8	And then...although, I got to figure out how to pay for that.
221.99	3.76	But hopefully, I'll find a job soon, or get an internship.
226.3	6.4	Internship I'm looking at, I got to go look at Cresilon still, because that one's a pretty good company, I think.
232.74	2.98	And then I got to go talk to Clancy.
235.82	1.54	I got to go work on my research stuff.
237.94	3.67	And check the simulations, figure out the new functionals.
242.13	2.47	Oh, none of them are converging.
247.42	1.76	Oh, my lips look chapped.
249.81	1.58	I guess it's pretty dry in the hospital.
253.07	2.74	But my ChapsStick's outside, along with all my other stuff.
256.47	3.72	Because those are all metal, and I cannot bring that into this room, because...
260.75	3.42	You know, the giant spinning magnet that's moving about my head.
268.36	1.15	I got to check on my car.
270.76	3.2	I got to go schedule an oil change soon, probably an alignment too.
274.48	1.29	It's been about a year since that.
276.02	3.67	And then I got to rotate my tires, but I think I got to schedule that with Costco.
280.52	1.24	For Friday?
281.98	1.19	Tomorrow, I think.
283.85	2.75	Tomorrow I can go at 11.
286.81	0.86	If I have time.
288.0	4.62	Because I don't have any class tomorrow, I just gotta make sure I get back before the office hours.
294.0	0.97	Oh, wait, tonight?
295.41	2.08	Oh, am I going to be able to go baking tonight?
297.69	3.64	Because I have B&B at 9.
301.36	4.51	Or, well, that's at 10, so depending on the time, people want to start baking.
305.99	1.66	I think I should be able to make it.
308.1	4.77	But if not, I'll see them tomorrow, because we'll have a meeting tomorrow at 7.
313.48	4.09	And then, after that I should be free for the rest of the day.
318.43	1.64	So, I can just spend it at home, I think.
321.45	5.04	Next Tuesday I have the movie, but then that's when the Apex season drops.
326.7	3.08	So, I probably want to play that with Jay and Ben.
330.47	8.14	Because we got to see how this new season plays out, well, all the balance changes and the class changes are going to come out.
338.67	3.42	So hopefully, that shouldn't be too hectic for the season.
344.53	3.66	And then, Geo is still out in Japan.
348.92	2.02	So, I won't be seeing him for a little bit.
350.98	2.81	I don't know what we'll be doing the next couple days after work.
353.92	0.94	And it'll probably be work.
355.33	11.42	Until Conscon, because that's when I'll see Anya and Tyler, I think.
367.03	2.7	But I got to reach out to them to see what their plans are.
370.48	2.7	And then when I'll be able to meet up with them, if I meet up with them.
373.69	1.76	But it shouldn't be too bad.
375.92	3.71	I got to go to the grocery store, not grocery store, but the restaurant store.
380.23	5.72	And pick up a grater for the garlic and ginger, along with a paring knife.
386.34	5.03	Because I am tired of cutting garlic that way with my big kitchen knife.
392.8	2.76	And I got to look into buying a smaller pot.
395.99	5.51	Cause the big stock pot that's there at home is pretty fine for like soups.
401.57	5.61	But if I want to heat up a small batch of stuff, then it's so big that it burns everything.
408.0	7.38	And then, I don't know if I want to clean that pan, because every time I've tried, it doesn't clean properly.
415.52	4.34	So I don't know, I have to continue looking into that, because I don't wanna strip the pan again.
420.49	3.18	Only for it to like season and then burn and flake off, so.
424.19	2.71	I'm not sure how people season those pans properly.
427.92	6.28	Ugh, and then the landlord is charging- I got to figure out why that gas bill is so high still.
434.23	8.62	But I had said that I was going to talk to Eric and Ryan downstairs about, but I haven't seen them in a while, so I wonder how they're doing.
442.96	7.49	I don't know if I've seen their car around, but it's also cold, so they haven't gone up to the roof to hang out for a while.
450.49	1.78	So that's also why I haven't seen them.
452.41	4.4	But hopefully it'll clear up soon, and be nicer to walk around.
456.91	2.28	Like yesterday was really nice after Thermo.
459.84	4.61	Like walking around was not hurting me at all, which is great.
464.69	18.88	And then hanging around after Transport and Thermo, I still think it's weird, but also really interesting that something that came from RPI, I don't know anybody that she mentioned from the faculty there, just because she was there in 2003.
484.09	4.95	And that was like Gabe's class, and I don't know when he'll be coming back.
489.1	1.17	I think that's next year.
490.48	0.69	The 75th?
492.32	7.71	Oh, but April is when my Nihon N grad weekend is, so I got to plan my trip for that.
500.07	6.12	I know Cammie and Chris are going up around that time, they got to call off work.
506.8	7.89	But I'll probably be driving on the weekend, or hopefully Friday night, or Friday afternoon, or early morning.
514.72	10.45	That way I can just get there early and hang out with everybody in the house, and meet up with everybody from PAL to help hang out or prepare for RPI and Nihon.
526.39	4.84	Probably I'll visit Bob at the shop and pick up some stuff while I'm down there.
531.31	8.15	I'm going to go look at what things I can slot into Serac, because I know I need a couple of other cards still from some older sets.
541.4	5.39	But maybe, I think at that point, I don't know if all will be one, or a machine more.
548.15	3.82	Or is it multi-versive machines or something like that?
552.0	1.27	I think that's what the reset is called.
553.99	4.16	But that should be coming out fairly soon, and then it's back to...
562.09	3.8	Not Elsabeth, but whatever reset that was.
566.22	1.65	Locked way, I don't remember what it's called.
569.11	1.5	Eldrain, Eldrain, that's what it's called.
571.91	6.22	But hopefully, I think Geo will be back to Philly by then.
578.77	3.71	So, we should be able to meet up at some point, and I can give him his cards.
582.51	4.16	And then probably try to visit with everybody in New York City.
588.73	3.88	Probably go visit Vanessa whenever I see her there.
593.86	1.92	But I just want to go back and take a nap.
596.83	1.56	But I've got so much work to do.
600.0	1.32	But that'll be fine.
