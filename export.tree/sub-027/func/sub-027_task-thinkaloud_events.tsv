1.46	6.48	It’s a little cool but the air feels kind of relaxing um
9.1	2.01	Not sure what I’m going to eat later today
11.11	4.24	but I should be changing my diet a little bit
15.69	2.22	I need to eat more fibrous foods
20.04	2.04	I don’t want to go to work tomorrow morning
22.49	4.13	I never get enough sleep so I’m always sleepy through throughout the day
27.3	3.72	And now I can’t focus as well
33.03	2.77	That little purple thing looks kind of like a dog
36.66	2.95	But not really I think I’m just imagining things really powerfully
43.48	1.49	A white cross this time
47.33	4.3	The scan noise is kind of drowns out my voice which is comforting I guess
53.86	3.24	I feel like I should be saying like more interesting things
57.1	4.2	but I don’t think I’m capable of saying these things
62.46	2.65	I also don’t know if I’m standing still enough
67.12	3.08	I kind of miss playing the violin but I also I don’t
71.51	2.95	I would never have any time to enjoy myself if I still had to practice
76.75	2.68	I wonder if I’m able to be heard by other people here
84.21	5.03	I think it was a good idea to take a nap before this experiment in the waiting room
91.07	2.77	I don’t think it would be possible for me to fall sleep here though
95.79	2.4	I’m really picky about how I can fall asleep
101.94	3.54	I wonder um if the burgers at Busboys are better now
106.42	3.09	The last time I went it was so bad and I don’t really know why
110.5	1.95	It took forever for the food to get here
113.41	8.07	It took like I kid you not like thirty minutes and I think it was I was ugh I remember it was so bad when it got here
122.15	1.49	The pickle was also really bad
127.51	2.23	I wanna play volleyball when I get back
130.85	1.68	I don’t know where it is the net though
133.98	1.41	My volleyball’s also at home
136.68	11.72	My dad also sent me mail that I got about my tax information that he didn’t tell me about or bring for two until two weeks later
148.7	3.4	so now im a little uh on edge I guess
155.64	1.77	I wonder how bad waxing hurts
158.21	7.12	I feel like it would not hurt as much as it looks but the way that people react actually kind of makes me nervous
168.59	1.95	I think about the current situation I’m in
172.2	10.29	It reminds me of this movie that I watched where the kids it was always raining on the planet
184.85	1.86	And they had to get all these bodily scans
187.17	7.52	And once every like seventy years or so I don’t remember correctly there would be like an hour of sun or something
195.36	7.49	And I remember those kids so happily just ran out into the field and enjoyed the sun but then it started raining really fast
206.88	4.55	I feel like plastic is so plentiful
211.43	2.44	but I don’t see it as much as I think I do
216.0	2.49	I don’t even know what I just said to be honest I’m just saying words
220.94	12.61	Honeygrow is so bad sometimes like I don’t understand how someone can justify paying twelve dollars for like a bowl of yogurt like that is actually ridiculous
234.72	9.57	Honeygrow takes a million years to prepare your food too I swear I have to wait at least twenty to twenty five minutes for them to prepare like one small bowl of noodles it’s actually insane
247.67	1.29	Smash is such a fun game
248.96	2.21	but I don’t even I don’t have time to play video games
252.62	1.59	Or I’m just not interested in them
255.2	1.0	Maybe both
258.38	1.21	I’m not sure what I want to drink today
259.59	7.41	I’m always in the mood for a specific cold refreshing drinks but I can never pinpoint which one exactly it is
267.94	8.43	But until I can find it I’m always going to be just a little unsatisfied but that one little piece really irritates me
280.09	1.68	Same thing goes for food
282.6	7.8	I never know what I’m going to eat but I just know that it is not going to hit the spot that’s the thing
292.53	1.32	I’m really bad at picking
298.11	2.13	I wonder what the next big movie is going to be
300.97	0.95	Highest grossing
303.42	2.49	Bitcoin is at twenty thousand dollars now
306.73	0.87	That’s kind of insane
307.6	2.03	I just lost so much money
312.21	3.54	I’m down like thirty percent this is actually ridiculous
320.57	1.32	I need to buy more
324.2	1.41	I want to go shopping
328.37	3.55	I would like to go shopping in a mall that has like temperatures like this
331.92	2.57	this is the ideal temperature that I want to be in
336.15	1.77	I don’t like it being warm all the time
338.86	9.21	It’s kind of annoying to be honest because these days it’s not even a relaxing temperature it’s more just like an annoying heat that makes you sweat
349.3	3.62	I wonder if I have hyperhidrosis that’s interesting
355.05	3.54	I wonder if I need to go on medication for that or if is that even curable?
361.52	6.03	This crosser thing this arrow or whatever this cross is really annoying me
368.92	3.54	I feel like there should be more added to the picture but there is never any
375.05	2.63	I wonder what kind of brain activity I’m doing right now
380.35	1.14	That looks like a snow globe
383.8	3.45	Wonder how much of my feet are showing or whatever I don’t know
389.5	2.0	I just wanna go home and eat food
391.6	1.58	I’m so tired
394.31	1.04	So exhausted
398.76	2.91	I wonder how fast time is going to go in this chamber
403.22	5.85	I slept so it didn’t really feel like that much time had passed but I guess it really did
410.52	2.04	I also hope the story isn’t going to be boring
414.7	1.8	I wonder what I’m going to eat for lunch tomorrow
416.5	2.67	I think I’m always wondering about food for some reason
419.17	5.96	but I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing you know cause I’m not really that conscious of what I’m putting into my body
425.7	1.68	I eat so many carbs everyday
428.78	1.14	Not enough fiber
430.91	2.14	Uh sugar a little bit on the high end
437.32	7.35	Fats uhh also a little bit on the high end but it’s like mostly like healthy fats I would say from meat
447.52	7.68	Protein intake is a little less it’s like probably zero point seven grams of protein for every pound in my body which is pretty good I think
455.2	1.25	but I’m not gaining anything
457.55	1.1	I need to hit the gym too
458.65	2.49	I wonder if the rec center is going to be open when I get back
462.53	1.09	I wanna play basketball
467.05	1.77	I wonder how much time it’s been
470.0	2.09	I swear I’ve been talking for a million years
474.73	2.04	I’m so glad I have a bigger bed now
477.38	3.62	I never knew what the luxuries of being able to move around were until just now
482.5	0.73	So nice
486.04	1.22	This isn’t my bed though
489.12	3.9	Oh my nose really itches but I can’t itch it this is really annoying
495.52	1.77	This always happens when I get haircuts too
498.3	4.81	Always makes me sit still and you know if you move they mess up your cut real bad
506.64	1.14	Ugh it’s really itchy
508.49	1.04	I wanna go on the subway
510.32	0.84	I want to eat subway
511.16	4.83	but the subway next to campus is like kind of questionable
518.83	2.08	I wish they had bamboo café was still here
520.91	1.19	I would eat there all the time
523.78	2.49	I wish I was still on dining dollar plan for free woowee
527.87	5.01	I had I wasted like a hundred dining dollars at the end of the semester because I just couldn’t spend it because
532.88	2.02	I got covid it was insane
536.71	2.77	Covid hit me so hard it was the worst experience of my life
540.25	1.27	I’m just remembering it now
543.83	3.25	I thought my I thought my voice would never come back
547.75	4.35	I thought my throat would never get rid of this pain hard to swallow it was so bad
552.74	8.11	Now I’m so thankful that I can actually just like sit down and not have a constant pain in the back of my throat that feels like my throat has been torn to shreds
562.23	4.17	Also I don’t know how loud the volume output from my mouth from my voice is
570.03	1.27	Ahh I wanna job
573.48	1.54	I need to get a job for next summer
577.83	3.72	Umm or else everyone’s going to get mad at me
582.2	3.45	It’s gonna be so annoying having people bug me all the time
588.87	1.67	I hope my parents lay off of my sister
591.5	1.55	It’s so annoying what’s going on
594.09	2.4	I really don’t understand why things have to be this way
597.63	1.86	It’s making me really irritated too
