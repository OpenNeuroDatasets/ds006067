onset	duration	transcript
1.74	1.98	Yeah, it's really strange.
3.75	3.77	I didn't really expect the machine to be as noisy as it is.
10.72	9.59	I don't really know how people fall asleep at all, so it's really weird that that happens in this rather cacophonous sound.
23.5	7.81	It would also be pretty awful for anyone to discover for the first time that they were claustrophobic just as they entered this, because...
33.06	0.52	Oof.
42.17	1.05	It is pretty noisy.
44.37	19.0	I don't know if the noise is mechanical and necessary for the MRI, or whether it's what the story is about, or how people manage to ignore or focus on specific aspects of sensory input.
70.12	8.22	The noise is pretty sharp.
86.04	7.86	I expected the screen to actually be...
95.99	15.67	I thought it would be inside, but I guess it makes more sense that it is outside, because you wouldn't want any interference from the electrical components inside the machine, even if it's just an LED.
122.23	5.96	Yeah, more or less I think my mind is just now in a very passive state because of the sound.
139.41	6.21	It doesn't feel as irritated now as it did earlier, which is interesting.
152.21	11.64	If I actually try to not think at all, and if I kind of zone out, then it almost seems as if it's just a normal part of life.
163.94	7.33	It's only when I try to do something that the sound seems harsh.
192.67	0.8	Yeah, it's interesting.
196.72	9.84	If I try to just not think of anything and just be mindful of the surroundings, all of it just washes over and doesn't really seem to bother me.
227.67	12.95	Usually, I guess if I was presented with slightly uncomfortable sensory stimuli, I'd probably just zone out.
240.8	11.62	But given that this is technically think aloud, I am trying to not just be completely silent, to actively spur my mind to think of things.
252.97	1.06	Whereas I think the normal...
254.7	5.71	Pretty sure the normal state in this...
261.23	7.36	While hearing this noise would just be to stop and not even try to think of anything.
277.78	6.45	Yeah, usually I find it very easy to just think of other things, but it's...
285.63	11.21	I guess I underestimated how silent my surroundings were, or how comfortable they were, when I usually do a lot of thinking.
299.1	2.52	And it's actively difficult to do it now.
316.1	5.7	So, it's also that the sound has a repeating thing, it isn't just...
325.39	1.09	So, it has an interval.
330.08	14.32	So, it goes with a few beats, and then it stops, and then goes with a few beats again, which I think if it was just continuously...
347.06	9.15	If it just went on continuously without a second layer of stopping and resumption of the beat, it would probably be more...
357.51	0.5	Bearable.
358.5	2.94	I mean it's bearable, it would probably be more...
365.0	0.24	Calm...
368.53	3.75	Less uncomfortable, less uncomfortable.
384.02	6.61	I don't know if the cushions near my head are just for immobilization, or whether they actually help in the scan.
393.78	4.47	They could just be only for immobilization and keeping the earphones inside.
402.36	4.71	I doubt... I don't know if they could help with...
407.74	3.95	Because, yeah, yeah, no, they'll probably just help immobilization.
412.1	5.66	If they were for helping with the MRI itself, it would be rather weird.
419.03	1.99	Because you ideally...
429.36	1.63	I actually don't know how the...
432.55	2.5	How MRI measures pressure changes.
440.83	4.93	I think somehow the MRI measures the blood flow.
449.07	0.79	I'm not sure it measures...
449.9	1.5	Just what does an MRI measure?
451.45	1.62	Does it measure pressure changes?
453.11	1.94	Does it measure electrical impulses?
464.66	3.05	I'm going to have to look it up, it's difficult to not look...
470.23	2.25	Just grown too used to looking things up.
474.57	5.14	So, not having access to Google immediately is kind of bothersome.
480.82	5.94	I could probably have Googled this immediately and gotten the answer.
495.57	17.03	You'd expect magnetic fields to look at electrical impulses, but you can definitely measure pressure by magnetic fields, so you know, just the physical phenomenon does not really, by itself preclude either possibility.
520.13	0.88	Actually the noise doesn't...
521.46	2.11	The noise doesn't bother me now, it's...
525.01	4.81	It's surprising how quickly people would get just...
529.9	5.11	Or at least I, I'm not sure how people in general get used to things, but...
536.32	5.22	I got used to this just being a fact of life for a while.
542.32	2.73	And now I can just think of other things regardless.
548.64	1.32	It is slightly...
550.37	1.29	It is very amusing.
568.62	0.99	I need to do...
573.97	3.17	I think I should read another...
578.75	4.49	Okay, I'm done with two thirds of the book.
584.0	2.62	I'll read another 150 today.
588.38	2.95	It'll just leave, so I should be done by tomorrow.
593.97	1.27	I'm done by tomorrow.
596.18	3.44	That means I can start writing the chapter.
