2.86	3.51	Okay, so… I’m still thinking about the mountain background
6.43	1.76	and how my colleague went to Spain
8.96	2.13	He mentioned that they went to Barcelona
11.09	4.22	I’m thinking about how they’re speaking Catalan in Barcelona
15.72	2.46	And now I’m think I should practice my Duolingo
18.74	1.94	I really want to learn Spanish
20.99	13.61	Um, I’m thinking about the marzipan that he brought back and how my dad always would have this, like, marzipan, uh, when I was a kid that was shaped like fruits and they’re so colorful and fun
35.16	10.28	I’m also thinking about how we went to BPS together with this colleague in San Francisco, and we all went to a bunch of restaurants,
45.56	3.97	and he was talking about how he got cookies from these nuns in Spain
50.04	2.08	I’m thinking about how I really want to go to Spain
52.52	9.6	and how when I was in seventh grade and eighth grade, Spanish class, we learned about Spain… or maybe tenth grade… ninth grade
62.79	3.81	And since then I’ve always wanted to go to Spain
67.15	2.32	Um, and I want to go Iceland now
70.05	4.61	The Bachelor finale – what a mess – uh, was in Iceland
74.73	1.58	I really want to see the mountains
77.22	7.79	I’m kinda noticing the scan and the, uh, like pillow thing under my feet right now
85.77	5.66	Um, I’m thinking about how I ran into Sam this morning at the GRO coffee hour
91.53	6.18	and how we talked about The Bachelor and how I’m annoyed that they’re gonna have two bachelorettes on the same season
98.46	8.35	That seems stupid to me and I also think that, just because they went through something traumatic together, doesn’t mean that they’re one unit now
106.83	2.2	I think that’s kind of sexist honestly
109.92	6.4	Um, I’m thinking about how I had a, like, pumpkin muffin thing but it was unlabeled so I don’t know,
116.82	6.49	but there was a dog there named Pumpkin and she, no he, was super cute and I saw Esther
124.22	6.99	And now I’m thinking about my other friend Esther and how we’re gonna see The Weeknd and how I’ve been listening The Weeknd so much recently
132.53	5.14	I’m kinda thinking still about the mountain background on the screen,
138.11	8.79	and I’m also thinking about how my mom just had an MRI like three days ago and I mentioned I had an MRI and she thought I’m crazy
147.37	7.73	And now I kinda see why ‘cause she’s really claustrophobic and I’m not, and I’m sure she’d have a much harder time with this, so I think that’s kind of funny
156.14	2.04	Uh, kinda just look at this cross
158.24	6.9	I accidentally sent a plus sign emoji to my friend who was COVID positive a while back, that was awkward
165.95	27.02	I’m thinking about how that friend and I do trivia together and that time that the trivia was a bunch of pasta shapes and how, um, we knew most of them and then Tanya got into this fight about fettuccine versus spaghetti, er, spaghetti versus linguine or something and how, like, each flour or egg mixture was, like, different
194.21	9.1	Um, I’m still thinking about my mom and my dad and how, um, my dad just had his Strain concert, so I kinda wonder how that went
204.37	22.33	I’m thinking about my experiment at work and if my gel is destained and how Amanda said that you need to load one to ten nanograms of protein – micrograms – and I loaded maybe one microgram at most, and I’m really hoping that, like, I have enough protein ‘cause I don’t particularly want to redo this experiment
227.43	3.88	I’m a little bit worried about that, but I guess I’ll find out tomorrow
232.27	11.63	Um, I’m kinda thinking about all my emails too right now and how I have to email some people about, um, like, making appointments
244.26	5.54	I’m thinking about how I’m gonna see Ben later and how he’s super cute
250.39	3.7	Um, I’m still thinking about my emails now
254.4	1.57	and now I’m thinking about my gel again
257.03	2.87	I’m kinda feeling my hands on my knees
260.75	5.05	Um, I’m thinking about how it was raining, and I wonder if it’ll still be raining when I leave
266.57	6.87	Um, er, it’s not raining now but it was raining earlier, but it wasn’t raining when I went to the bus
274.67	15.83	Um, I’m thinking about the bus ride and how, like, it was really fast, and last time I took the bus on a Monday, on a weekday, in the middle of the day at this time, there was like a ton of random traffic and me and, like, ten other people were late for forum
291.81	6.32	But then during that forum, Ron was there and Ron is super cool and we got to say hi which was awesome
298.64	2.67	And I think it’s hilarious that he still has his ponytail
302.51	5.9	And August was not there which was annoying and I couldn’t see August this week ‘cause she was sick
309.43	0.82	But she’s really cool
310.26	1.35	and I like walking with her
312.66	10.07	Um, kinda just feeling my feet in my shoes a little bit ‘cause, yeah, um, ‘cause they’ve been, like, sitting here for a while
323.44	10.69	I’m still kinda thinking about August and how we have our walking chicks thing, where we walk around all the time, and I’m sad she’s leaving but she’s going to D. C
334.16	17.23	And then I’m gonna go to D. C probably next weekend to fly kites, and I’m thinking about how, um, I don’t own a kite, and that’s definitely… I’m just gonna watch the other kites I guess, but I think it’d be funny to, like, bring a Safeway bag with a string tied to it
352.04	10.35	And I think that’d be funny, but I think no one else would think that’s funny, but, um, so it’s kinda what I’m thinking about, if I should actually convince Ben to do that or if that’s just a stupid idea
363.48	17.35	Um, I’m thinking about Amanda and how I hope her experiment is going well and how I’m sad that she’s having trouble right now, but science is hard and, um, thinking about how it’s really fun to message her and I was glad we were able to get coffee earlier
381.34	2.35	I’m still thinking about the dog, Pumpkin
384.59	0.91	He was really cute
386.23	11.98	I was pretty into seeing Pumpkin and there was another dog yesterday that I saw, who jumped on me, which I do not like, something about that, but I did get a really cute picture
399.0	5.62	Um, so at least I got that to remember him jumping on me which I did not like
405.74	6.2	Um, and I saw Danny and now I’m just thinking about the breakroom and when I was eating lunch
411.96	8.45	and watching The Bachelor recap which was really interesting ‘cause it was, I mean, like, basically the same thing as what I saw but at least had some jokes
420.95	13.04	And now I’m thinking about Charles and how he’s upset about how he got COVID a few weeks ago and, um, how he thinks that maybe our other friend gave it to him, so that was awkward
434.07	3.45	But he is just like such a good bean
437.96	13.12	Um, I’m kinda just thinking about, still The Bachelor, um, and how I’m kind of not into the bachelor’s choices and why he acted the way he acted
451.13	18.11	Like the whole season he was kind of just dumb, and then at the end he was even more stupid, and I don’t think that the girl he ended up with is, like, she’s fine, but, like, I feel bad for her because she has to live with the fact that he is not making smart choices
470.15	5.33	Um, I’m still thinking about being in the breakroom and kind of how I was looking out at Homewood
475.59	8.44	and now I’m thinking about how I’m kind of showing a prospective student around, um, tomorrow, and how we’re gonna get lunch and me and Harry decided to go to Gertrude’s
484.03	11.59	I’ve actually never been there, so that’s kind of exciting, ‘cause I’ve heard that it’s good, and I wanted to go to lunch with this speaker, like, two days ago and I wasn’t able to because I thought I was gonna be doing an experiment
496.13	6.84	And then my yeast didn’t freaking grow, so I was not able to do the experiment, but I was at least able to see her talk
503.6	4.68	But then the whole time I didn’t really understand what was going on during the talk so that was awkward
509.35	6.64	But I was really, really glad the talk is in person, because I’m kinda sick of, like, all these Zoom meetings, all the time
516.55	7.53	I really like to be able to, like, be in a room with other people and feel this, like, collaborative, kind of, you know, spirit in the air
524.8	26.4	Uh, but I’m thinking about how her stuff about the ribosome was really interesting, um, but definitely how I think that, um, like, it was complicated and now Steven was talking about how he wishes it was, like, less complicated the way it was presented, but I think that… I think it would have been, like, a disservice to show it as less complicated because, um, it is complicated
551.68	5.43	Now I’m kinda just thinking about the Office, the Office Ladies podcast, and how I wanna listen to it later
557.95	8.94	I’m trying to remember if I finished… I did finish Murder, so now it’s on the Lover, that’s the hilarious episode, um, so I’m really excited
567.0	5.91	I’m just thinking about that podcast and how I’m sad that all issues didn’t come out with a new one so that was kind of a bummer
573.8	6.01	Um, kinda looking at the fixation cross ‘cause I feel like there’s, like, a circle around it but maybe I’m just crazy
580.64	4.25	Uh, kinda just noticing, like, the ceiling a little bit
585.91	8.89	Um, kinda just thinking about how ten minutes is a lot longer than I thought, um, even though it’s chill, just thinking about it
595.53	4.61	Um, kind of, like, noticing that the cross is yellow
