1.93	7.39	So I am thinking about how you know how when you write a word a million times and then it kinda stops making any sense
10.0	2.22	Staring at wait just now watching it on the screen
12.52	5.37	it kind of started making like it looked like waif and then I was like what even is a waif um
18.71	2.58	And so now the word wait has lost all meaning
21.48	8.02	which reminds me of when I was in like middle school and I was learning how to conjugate verbs in French
30.36	9.53	I don’t remember which verb it was but I wrote one of them out probably like five hundred times in an attempt to learn how to conjugate it and by the end
41.52	15.21	By the end I was like what is what is a to be and it was almost like in those college philosophy classes where you’re just like rambling about like what is it to be a human or to be part of a whatever and it just none of it really makes any sense
56.73	6.56	I was a terrible philosophy student which is not surprising to anyone who’s met me
63.29	6.92	I met one guy when I was in god where was I Colombia staying in a hostile and he was really into philosophy
70.21	3.53	He was like for fun he would sit and read all of these philosophy books
74.42	10.39	Um and he met me and I don’t remember what he said but like it was something that came out from one of his books and I just rejected the premise of it immediately because I was like
85.44	4.41	It was it was so dumb and I completely was unable to have a conversation about it
89.85	7.22	And I kind of felt like a dick afterwards because I was like this guy’s just tryna tryna have this conversation about something interesting he read from his book
97.07	3.72	But it was like it was such an absurd question it was like what if red is not red
100.79	3.08	And im like okay but like red is red it’s a wavelength it’s a color
104.41	3.0	Um and he’s like well yea but what if red wasn’t red
107.41	2.76	And I’m like yea but like red is a wavelength um
112.03	2.32	But yea I just kinda completely rejected that
114.35	14.6	He and I we were the only people at the hostile who were like of he went to Stanford and obviously I went to Hopkins and so we were like bonding over the shared trauma of these insane universities
129.38	6.8	He has completely like stopped he’s like some TikTok influencer about like crypto currency investing
136.72	6.31	And so we’ve kind of taken different pathways out from the the sh shared trauma of higher education
143.8	2.59	Um honestly he’s probably having way more fun
146.48	6.3	he bought like some like tiny cottage in rural New York and is building like a little farm house out there
154.09	2.68	And I do not have a farm house I have a row home
156.77	3.54	I like the row home but I really do wish I had more space to garden
160.31	3.62	And in upstate New York you have less of space to garden
164.39	5.21	Um it doesn’t stop me from spending probably ninety percent of my money on flowers
170.33	6.24	But ninety percent of almost zero it still not that much so I feel justified in spending it on flowers
176.57	10.43	And I buy all like native like locally grown plants because like you do an environmental health PhD you have to at least like walk a little bit of the talk um
187.63	4.99	Also I like that they don’t have to be watered as much because I keep leaving to go kayaking on the weekends
193.39	7.35	And then all of my non-native plants die um but the native ones are still kicking some how although I cannot keep anything alive in the window box
201.55	6.31	I have like a coco fiber liner for it and it just like hemorrhages out all of the water that I pour into it
208.2	9.29	And so even though it’s one of my favorite places to put flowers cause I think it just looks like so cute and cottagey with all the like bright and colorful flowers I cannot keep anything alive
217.49	5.94	And my roommate says she’s gonna water them when I go out of town but she like she doesn’t remember she barely remembers to water her own plants
224.39	6.3	And so I have probably like filled it and then have everything die and then like refilled it like three times by now
230.69	9.75	And at this point I’m mostly just planting succulents which is like it’s working out better for me but I don’t love the vibe of the succulents as much Connor really does
240.44	5.49	We have this like succulent hanging basket that he loves and um he wants twenty more of them
247.25	1.09	I like flowers
248.59	2.4	I’ve like flowers since I was like little
251.63	4.35	My dad’s favorite picture of me is from this hike we did when we were I was probably two
256.57	9.3	And I wandered off into this like field of wild flowers and it was just like sitting there with my older sister nestled in the flowers just like in awe of the flowers
266.4	6.07	And it’s it’s a pretty cute picture cause we were very little and little kids are cute and flowers are fucking fantastic
273.11	5.39	Um also I put a lot of flowers on my dresses when I was a kid
279.41	3.99	My grandmother was once very upset that I had flowers all over my dress
283.99	8.17	And I we were hanging out at their pool and my filled my little like water can full of pool water and then watered my dress because I had to water the flowers
292.16	5.45	Um but also I was watering all of her like garden flowers with pool water which is probably not very good
298.65	4.72	And now I am thinking about how loud this beeping is it’s kind of distracting
303.37	8.34	And my forehead is a little warm but my legs are cool so I guess it evens out into an average temperature of a person
312.3	4.93	And there’s like a little pink spot on the bottom of the screen that I think kind of looks like a dog
317.78	6.76	and it’s a little bit of like a Rorschach test although I think that that is all kind of like pop psychology
325.45	2.43	Um but Connor’s dad is a psychoanalyst
327.98	2.32	and I always worry that he’s like judging me a little bit
330.3	4.45	Like when I first would go up to the farm he made some question
335.41	12.38	Like they were arguing about something other at the table and he asked me if my family argued like that at the table and I was just like I don’t know how to answer this in a way that makes you think I and my family are not insane
348.06	4.9	Um and so I was just going like ahaha we hang out um
354.55	4.09	But I have never bonded with Connor’s father the same way I I get along with his mom
359.21	4.63	His mom is great I both of his parents are great but his mom is just very sweet
363.84	6.98	And also now that I do not have a mother I feel like there’s like more of a role for her in my life um
372.68	6.73	Yea she sent me this really cute video like right before I came her of dance moves from like the nineteen fifties through the twenty twenties
380.3	10.66	And we’re not quite like at a stage where like I would be like complaining to her about how boring my lab meeting is and how my cells don’t look good and how I’m gonna go do this and how my day’s busy
391.59	2.32	Um but I think it’s really cute that she like
394.88	3.18	Her leg is broken so she’s just kind of like holed up on the sofa all the time
398.61	6.8	And I think it’s cute that she like while she’s sitting there with her broken leg she sees these videos and she’s like ah I’ll send them to Alex
406.08	1.76	Cause my family doesn’t really do that as much
408.16	4.17	My aunt found a cool moth and she sent that to us we have like a group chat with everyone in it
412.33	10.43	And she like she sent her cool moth or like people will send like old pictures that like pop up on their timelines but not just like hey I saw this video and I thought it was cute here you go
424.34	5.94	But I have also just been like a little annoyed with my family because it seems like they’re trying to fix like everything like
431.22	4.45	The grad student that I I worked with um died on Friday
435.9	14.19	And I messaged my sisters about it because I was kind of just like in a weird headspace um cause he was like not even thirty like he was probably twenty seven and he just got engaged he was about to finish his PhD and then he’s just dead
450.37	8.11	And I messaged my sisters and they’re like trying to solve it like my older sister’s like well maybe you should go get like this maybe you need to take a nap maybe you need to do this
458.48	11.39	And I’m like I don’t need you to fix my problems for me I just wanted to like express that like this is kind of a crazy thing that like people just die
469.87	5.4	Now everyone I’ve known who’s died has just been like alive alive alive and then like dead like cancer
475.81	7.16	I started reading um Tuesdays with Morrie last night so now I’m probably also thinking a little bit more about death and dying I’m not sure
483.65	1.74	Connor had recommended Tuesdays with Morries
485.47	7.62	but I Morrie singular Morrie but I hadn’t picked it up because I had read other books and it kind of just sounded depressing
494.86	2.06	But I picked it up last night and I started reading it
496.96	1.98	and it’s like a shockingly easy book to read
499.98	10.3	It also reminds me a lot just in um may I studied for my med school board uh duh bluh bluh bluh bluh board exam for two months
510.55	12.83	And then like the Thursday before I took it I took it on a Saturday the Thursday before I took it Connor’s granddad like falls into a coma and is just kind of knocking on death’s door
523.38	3.9	And they sent him home from the hospital to uh be at home in hospice care
527.92	4.67	And then I like took my board exam and I ran up to Massachusetts to be with Connor and his family
532.59	8.25	And then he died but it was kind of like in the book where like you know you watch someone like slowly and slowly and slowly decaying um
541.11	9.66	Also the sound of this machine I hear it with the respirators also in our lab like we have cell incubators in the the tanks that like regulate the carbon dioxide and the nitrogen
551.34	2.13	They kind of make like a puffing sound
553.47	4.91	And when before the machine started up when I was still out in the waiting room I heard the kind of puffing sound
558.43	6.2	and it’s the same sound as like a dying person on a respirator which is like the slow puffs of air
565.44	4.86	And so now I just feel like I am a little surrounded by death at all times
570.3	4.26	And then also like my friend Serena her gran- no her dad died
575.12	10.52	And she was talking a lot about how when she was like sitting with him in the hospital as he died of cancer that she was just kind of surrounded and haunted by the sounds of death
586.55	6.98	And I know that there’s like a lot of sounds that like I could be associating with puffs of air but I don’t love that it’s now that but also
593.53	5.76	Oh I am just like on a tangent here [laughs] um yea
