2.49	6.64	The cold today sort of reminded me of when I got stuck on the flights with Southwest this past Christmas.
9.35	4.3	I had to wake up so early in the morning to get a good flight and it was so cold.
14.19	4.76	And how everybody else was like trapped in the cold, trapped in line at the airport.
19.83	8.5	Speaking of travel, there's been a lot of travel plans that I've had to make with my family on my mom's side because of graduation.
28.73	6.82	Trying to juggle flight plans back and forth, achieving all of them, trying to find the best lodging available for everyone.
36.85	6.3	And speaking of graduation, it's coming up for me, like at the end of May for everybody.
44.17	2.8	And there's definitely a lot of things I've got to get done beforehand.
47.43	15.96	I meant to come to the campus actually much earlier today to try to finish printing a few things for my portfolio, but I decided to continue working from home so it would be easier to take the bus here and just get off at Kennedy Krieger.
64.07	4.5	I've definitely been able to get a lot more rest since I've been working from home so much.
68.67	11.02	It's been very relaxing, a little bit lonely, but I don't mind since I have such a flexible schedule when it comes to preparing for all my portfolio items that I need to prepare for.
80.29	6.98	Speaking of my portfolio, I finished my professional development class recently with my program director and all my other classmates.
87.63	6.18	And it was very fun to be able to go to the dinner party that my program director hosted at her house on Thursday night.
94.43	12.2	It was so fun to get to casually talk to all my classmates, be all together for once instead of being in the school environment like we usually are, and get to hang out with Nicole since I don't get to see her often.
109.23	9.8	Well, it definitely made a lot of memories that night, and I'm so glad that my program director is such a good cook because all the Greek dishes that she made were just so freaking good.
119.67	3.22	And she had like basically olives in everything.
124.63	4.38	And I think it's so funny, one of the jokes that my program director...
129.15	13.84	It wasn't really a joke, but she was excited to show off a white elephant that she had. And one of my classmates mistaken it for something else, but I'm pretty sure she didn't hear what it actually was, which made it a lot funnier that she just tried to play it off.
143.91	5.54	And I'm honestly not sure if she heard it, but I'm glad she didn't because it was a little bit inappropriate for him to say.
149.73	1.24	It was funny nonetheless.
152.73	3.21	And then yesterday, speaking of the cold,
155.98	2.56	I went out and ordered a pizza last night.
158.54	1.95	It was really cold, per usual.
161.25	4.54	Last time I ordered a pizza, it was like even colder than it was today, actually.
166.29	1.7	The wind was so frigid.
168.65	5.18	Earlier that day, I was walking through such like frigid temperatures with my...
174.83	5.92	To go visit my classmate at the Enoch Pratt Library so we could work on writing our thesis together.
180.77	8.26	Like we kind of do almost every Friday, but she's been busy a lot lately because she has to expedite the schedule for finishing her thesis product on time.
190.41	4.37	Whereas mine is almost done, but there's a few things I need to tweak on my thesis product.
195.44	10.19	And I hope I can get it out by maybe Monday or Tuesday, so that way my thesis advisor can kind of finish giving feedback on a few things.
206.95	3.84	And my classmate, Ji-Young, she's knitting me a hat.
210.97	1.9	She's so good at knitting and crocheting.
213.03	2.78	She just recently bought a needle set, actually.
216.27	7.06	It's like the whole crochet set, I think, it has a bunch of needles, cost her a bunch of money, and she's so excited to get that.
224.91	5.08	And we're really good friends, and she offered to knit me a hat because she has so much leftover yarn.
230.53	11.18	So, she's making me a kind of a dark blue, light blue mix knit hat, which I'm very excited for because I really like actually receiving beanie caps.
242.05	3.5	It's probably the only kind of hat I wear, to be honest.
246.91	1.56	I'm not really much of a hat person.
249.15	7.38	And then to thank her for giving me the beanie, I'm going to be giving her some cookies because it's the only thing I'm able to really bake at my tiny little apartment.
257.17	2.65	And I think they're probably going to be chocolate chip
259.99	2.94	because it seems like most of my classmates, I never bring cookies for them.
263.45	1.66	I like chocolate chip cookies.
266.89	7.32	Speaking of cookies, I made these orange cookies the other night for the program director dinner party we had.
274.79	8.64	And when I asked people to request what kind of cookies they want, they asked for the most labor intensive cookies that I've made before, which is kind of a pain, but at least they taste good.
284.09	4.58	They kind of remind me of Walmart sugar cookies, like the texture of them at the very least, like how thick they are.
290.51	1.55	So, it goes to show they're good in that regard.
292.06	8.81	It's really handy because one of my classmates is gluten free, so I'm glad I was able to kind of provide something that she could have an accommodation for for dessert.
301.29	5.22	Speaking of gluten free, my boyfriend is also gluten free, which is the reason why I bake gluten free most of the time.
307.03	7.62	Honestly, I feel like I can't really tell the difference between gluten free and regular flour baked goods.
315.59	6.84	I mean, cookies are pretty simple, so I'm not really sure of a lot of the differences between them in terms of structure.
322.89	6.01	Because I know when it comes to baking gluten free pies, my boyfriend's dad has a secret way of doing it.
328.9	1.37	I think it's a blind bake.
330.93	10.62	I think he blind bakes the crust or something so that way the gluten doesn't collapse or it's too soggy, like the gluten free flour rather doesn't collapse or get too soggy or something.
342.39	2.48	I think I'd like to try making a pie, I'm afraid.
345.55	0.86	I'll leave Baltimore.
347.09	2.16	I'm not exactly sure what kind of pie I want to make.
350.73	2.38	Speaking of pies, my mom makes a mean key lime pie.
353.97	3.78	I kind of hope that she'll make me one whenever I come home.
358.21	2.1	Her key lime pies are like the perfect level of tart.
360.99	4.04	Man, they're so good and the graham cracker crust is really hard to beat.
365.61	4.0	I wonder if there's a good way to make a good gluten free graham cracker crust.
370.31	6.12	But that would require like, sourcing out gluten free graham crackers, which I don't think I could buy at a Walmart in Oklahoma very easily.
376.57	0.82	I'd have to think about it.
378.17	8.56	I guess I'll have to ask my boyfriend to see if he has any ideas, or if there's a good place to buy gluten free crackers.
387.81	8.66	Speaking of Oklahoma, I'm kind of trying to figure out the best logistics to move back because I have lots of big items that I have to sell off.
396.99	6.7	Speaking of which, I kind of actually, for spring break, I think I need to get down to business to making actual lists for them.
404.13	6.26	Because it's a lot of items I'm thinking of selling off, so that way I don't have to get a moving thing like a U-Haul or etc.
410.57	1.1	They're so expensive.
412.41	3.82	I guess it costs thousands of dollars, and I told my mom that before.
416.79	2.24	Because recently she was like, oh, how are we going to get back to Oklahoma?
419.11	0.98	Why don't you rent a U-Haul?
420.87	2.68	And I said, well, it costs like $2,000 to rent a U-Haul.
424.41	1.32	So, moving is expensive.
425.85	0.78	Baltimore is expensive.
427.69	3.72	But I don't want to live back in the Midwest, even though it's cheap to live there.
431.99	5.18	I think ideally when I find a job, it would be nice to move back to the East Coast.
438.21	3.6	But the only place I would not want to move is Florida, speaking of the East Coast.
442.95	2.62	Yeah, Florida is probably too humid, too weird.
446.21	3.92	I mean, it's one of the most infamous states in the United States, so there's that.
452.27	2.16	And I'm just looking forward to graduation in general,
455.11	1.54	since I get to actually see my family again.
456.65	6.92	Like my aunt, my cousins, my uncle, who I haven't seen since high school graduation.
463.81	1.94	So, it would be really nice to catch up with all of them.
466.17	1.28	I can go to DC,
467.99	3.34	because I've only been to D.C. once with my boyfriend when he's visited me a couple times.
471.35	1.08	We went to the Smithsonian.
473.09	8.4	I got to kind of like blitz through like three or four places we went to, because he just wanted to see so much, and we were so exhausted afterwards.
481.99	5.42	So, I wonder if I'll feel the same way when my family's here and we do our traveling days.
487.41	2.54	Like we're doing like a couple of days travel, I think, in D.C.
490.41	6.98	Like going back and forth between Baltimore and DC, which is kind of like, logistically, yeah, I just hope that works out.
498.29	3.67	Because I remember the first time I came to Baltimore, and I was like in a logistical mess,
501.99	2.4	so I'm assuming my mom here, she's helping me.
504.85	12.94	Like oh, my gosh, like all of the weather delays that we had, like all of the everything that we had, like the luggage delays, it was an incredibly long process to finally get to Baltimore.
519.63	6.4	And so, obviously like plane factor won't be an issue in traveling to DC, because we're just like taking the train and the metro there.
527.15	5.8	But still, I wonder what, if any, we'll encounter in a logistical situation, traveling back and forth.
533.53	2.2	And also, D.C. is really expensive too.
535.73	7.16	Like thankfully the Smithsonian is free, but food is just like so expensive in D.C, like getting around.
543.25	5.9	I honestly have no idea what my relatives would also be interested in seeing while we're there.
549.15	3.06	Because my uncle in particular just likes to see random stuff across the US.
552.27	12.06	Like the one time he visited me for high school graduation, he like drove from Rochester all the way to Bartlesville, which is on his tiny little car.
564.41	9.3	And so, I wonder if he's wanting to see anything in particular in DC, given that he likes to see things like the largest ball of yarn in Kansas.
574.73	1.26	He's very random.
576.53	1.99	And DC is full of lots of interesting stuff,
578.56	4.05	so I think it'll be a little more exciting than seeing the largest ball of yarn.
582.71	1.22	Or no, it's not yarn.
584.41	2.22	It's the largest ball of twine in Kansas.
588.03	7.14	That'll be interesting to see what his opinions are, since he's also lived in the Northeast longer.
595.27	9.97	Like my aunt and my uncle both live in the Northeast, but most of the rest of my family lives in just like the Midwest.
