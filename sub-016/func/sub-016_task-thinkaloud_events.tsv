3.4	3.65	So um Hi I’m Yuzo.
7.1	2.04	I’m in an mri scanning.
9.22	0.81	It’s kinda cool.
14.32	4.74	It is quite as noisy but I was expecting more of a machine sounding sound.
19.09	2.09	Well that’s pretty neat.
23.51	5.04	The screen that’s a little bit off center is a little bothering but it’s not too concerning.
28.55	5.15	Maybe will keep me away from boredom um in here.
37.78	2.43	But yeah it’s kind of a cool mirror set up.
40.48	4.12	I can see things um.
49.8	8.07	Guess am I comfortable now that I’m here um I feel more at peace?
64.01	2.88	Feels like a helmet I wear for fencing.
67.37	4.15	Uh I did fencing uh Japanese fencing.
72.48	4.11	So it’s kind of like a similar face setup, small slit.
81.8	0.74	10 minutes.
87.18	4.63	Maybe yeah I’ll talk about what I do uh.
92.92	19.05	I’m a PhD student at Hopkins doing astronomy so completely different things but uh um I guess we use big telescopes and not a brain scanning machine but um yeah.
112.3	1.77	I guess the setup is similar.
114.07	8.2	We we we start up, calibrate, have some sample things going on, do scans.
126.19	12.44	Yeah so I study things called black holes um theyre guess pretty quite common in our universe.
139.67	6.37	Uh although I do get often get questions about why why do people care about astronomy um.
148.25	8.62	I’ve kinda given up on those answers cause I can’t compete with medical people doing real research.
159.0	1.23	I just theyre just ranting.
161.56	5.58	Uh but yeah maybe we can learn more about world we live in.
167.44	1.23	That’s kinda what I’m interested in.
170.22	4.22	Uh we do have a big telescope launching 2 weeks.
175.1	2.03	Hopefully it goes well um.
178.72	12.03	There’s a lot of people at Hopkins involved so apparently we’re going to have a big launch party so theyre going to take the football field and project the launch happening.
192.16	4.62	So I guess that’s a big deal uh and I’m involved with that so.
197.89	1.28	Uh I’m excited.
199.39	6.39	Um I don't know my feel body feels tenser than before, maybe just my hands?
206.91	1.71	Um maybe just a sound.
210.69	2.17	Huh 10 minutes is longer than I thought.
217.9	1.73	Be kinda cool if the cross moves around.
223.93	1.65	It would be fun to.
225.94	3.61	Kinda like that board game chase the book.
237.85	5.85	Um Uh yeah so this will be my first brain scan.
243.8	2.74	I hope nothing bad comes out um.
249.09	4.11	No idea what my brain looks like so that’ll be nice to see if I get to see it.
256.68	8.44	I don't really look at brains so don’t really know what to expect so maybe ill look that up later, something new to learn.
273.46	3.84	The whirring noise kinda gets you later on.
288.33	14.59	Oh uh I don’t know if it’s a common thing but do cat people are cat people do people have cats.
304.71	7.46	So I like cats but I have cat allergies if that’s impossible but I always eat with my friends who have cats.
313.7	3.53	You know a lot of people who like cats are allergic so I don't know if its common.
325.25	4.81	Say I catsitted last week, maybe more over the break.
331.94	4.25	My friends like their cats but they don’t like to travel with them so.
338.3	2.11	It’s kinda fun to play with them um.
364.44	7.65	Well I guess the color is a little off on the screen so the blue and the greens are a little off.
372.38	4.82	So I see two crosses, one’s blue one’s yellowish.
378.47	2.15	Actually all texts were a little bit off.
381.76	1.1	Maybe the projector’s old um.
389.83	0.97	Maybe it’s the screen.
392.32	1.1	It is a little off center.
398.78	14.87	Um I don’t know if it’s if it’s the mirror or my eyes but it also looks a little defocused.
416.31	8.53	Um yeah um telescope we we operate telescopes we really care about focusing.
426.76	26.47	So our first operation is we find a bright star, calibrate it, focus it and then take long exposures so the things I study are very very very faint so uh even with the biggest telescopes they need to point at an object for about two hours to get okay signal.
453.52	1.9	And maybe you won't see anything.
457.4	2.84	Um feels like my body is spinning.
460.6	0.61	I know its not.
464.96	2.4	It’s just my eyes getting tired, that’s probably it.
474.24	10.22	I don't know if it’s the noise but my eye is start to follow the uh the machine patterns though looks like its jiggling back and forth.
502.4	2.63	Yeah it’s a nice medical campus.
505.03	2.19	Well I haven’t seen it I just walked past it so.
515.16	1.14	It would be nice to have a clock.
521.84	2.08	Oh wow my body feels like it’s really spinning.
525.73	2.49	Feel my brain just getting tired oh wow.
529.57	0.88	Weird sensation.
532.45	9.64	Uh spin uh.
560.12	4.07	Yeah I guess the medical campus is far from Homewood um.
566.1	3.79	I know that from my map but never taken the bus down here.
571.18	3.37	Uh I wonder what’s out here to eat.
575.45	1.71	Well do people where do go?
577.37	0.87	Where do people go?
580.18	1.64	Or do people just go to downtown?
595.97	2.33	I wonder if people enjoy MRI scans.
599.9	1.04	There’s something oh.
