5.1	6.03	I went running right before I came in to get my scan done, down by the water in Fells.
12.15	1.28	I was running on red brick.
14.84	1.55	The brick is always so red.
17.78	1.77	I ran further than I normally do.
20.55	5.73	I've been running two or two and a half miles, but today I ran almost four, which is good.
27.38	1.46	But I had to walk a lot of the time.
30.64	2.25	I need to run more often so that I can walk less
35.03	5.09	Going swimming tomorrow with Fang, that'll be fun, I hope I'm not too tired.
40.87	5.02	I have a long day tomorrow, the interview is supposed to last from 8:00 to 3:00.
47.86	4.12	Maybe I'll take a nap afterwards, since we're not going swimming until much later.
53.52	3.93	Fang wants to lift before too, but he told me that he was tired.
57.74	2.22	His muscles were sore from lifting earlier in the week.
61.64	1.74	I wonder if I'll do arms or legs.
65.02	0.69	Arms maybe.
66.96	1.65	I don't wanna be sore in my legs.
70.35	1.01	This weekend should be fun.
72.49	1.04	I don't know what we're gonna do.
74.59	1.9	Fang said he would find something for us to do.
78.38	2.01	He always plan such interesting dates.
82.53	1.57	Maybe I'll meet up with my friend Albert.
85.53	1.1	We're overdue to meet up.
86.79	2.08	We were supposed to meet up last week, but then we couldn't.
90.69	3.36	I saw the parade in Hamden last weekend, that was nice.
94.98	3.55	I really liked the dancers, the the cultural dancers.
99.69	1.99	Fang knew what all the flags were in the parade.
103.15	1.53	I knew Mexico, and that was about it.
106.03	0.97	Think I called it Spain.
109.34	1.48	We got hot chocolate during the parade.
112.17	0.64	That was really good.
115.03	2.03	We were gonna make our own, but then we ended up buying it.
119.08	0.88	Zara was there.
122.72	3.66	He did a good job taking care of her, although I'm upset that she was sick while he was there.
128.46	1.03	She's better now though.
131.43	7.32	She was sleeping under my heavy comforter when I left, I hope she can breathe, it gets so hot under there.
140.58	4.35	I'm anxious that one day I'll come back to my house and find her suffocated under the blanket.
147.61	2.26	I think that's unlikely to happen though.
150.97	1.56	She's just taking a cat nap.
154.89	2.89	I hope she eats her breakfast, it was only half gone when I left.
159.33	1.47	I should have had more for breakfast.
161.78	4.83	I had some eggs after I came back from my run, but I don't think it was enough.
167.95	1.02	I cooked them in butter.
170.37	2.55	I should have cooked them in veggie oil or olive oil.
173.42	1.0	That would've been healthier.
176.32	1.36	I need to get some protein powder.
178.76	4.95	I usually have protein shakes after I run, but I'm out
183.86	1.62	I've been out for a couple weeks now.
187.41	7.11	The protein powder is cheapest at the Walmart in Catonsville, but it's such a long drive to get out there, I don't go very often.
196.28	5.83	I think I'm just gonna bite the bullet and go to Target and get some, it would be more expensive but I like going to Target.
204.45	11.16	I don't have too much money to waste on things I don't need at Target though, I need to remember to use my coupon, and not get distracted by the candle oil.
218.59	1.53	I have a long day ahead of me today.
221.18	3.77	I'm not looking forward to my ____ meeting.
226.36	4.57	At least I can only stay an hour, then I have to go to that other Zoom with the residents.
232.28	2.84	They seem like they're all really outgoing and I'm not very outgoing.
236.18	2.8	I hope it doesn't last too long, I hope it's not awkward.
239.77	1.84	Some of these meet and greets are really awkward.
243.85	6.66	The program seems like it's doing a lot to try to prevent that though, and it seems like it's a pretty good group.
251.31	0.81	Maybe I'll enjoy it.
254.18	1.56	I wonder what I'm having for dinner tonight.
257.31	2.77	I'm thinking about the butternut squash ravioli that I've been saving.
261.98	2.96	I can't decide what kind of sauce I wanna put on top of it though.
266.29	0.76	Marinara?
268.34	1.55	Maybe I'll just top it with some butter.
271.18	5.54	Maybe I'll borrow Anita's pesto, but I don't think pesto and butternut squash go together.
278.79	1.92	Maybe I'll just toss it with some olive oil.
284.25	2.3	I should really try to use more basil in my cooking.
287.38	4.09	I mean, I grew it to use it and now I barely even use it, now the plant is dying.
293.03	1.42	Maybe I should make my own pesto.
296.29	2.14	I need to get some pine nuts if I wanna do that.
299.43	2.52	I made it with, uh, sunflower seeds last time.
302.29	6.0	No, I made it with, uh, pumpkin seeds last time and it wasn't very good.
309.49	0.96	Fang said he liked it though.
311.86	1.46	He always says he likes everything I cook.
314.52	0.81	I think he lies.
316.48	1.89	I think he lies to make me feel good, but that's okay.
322.34	2.43	Maybe I'll be healthy and have the salad for dinner instead.
329.73	2.09	I need to use the sprouts before they go bad.
334.09	1.02	I hope Zara eats her dinner.
336.78	1.46	I need to wash her bowl when she's done.
338.97	2.61	I need to give her fresh water, it's been too long.
341.94	0.95	She doesn't drink enough water.
344.24	3.16	I should probably vacuum my room too, I've been putting that off.
348.28	2.54	No, not today, I have too much to do.
351.94	2.11	It'll be late by the time the meet and greet is done.
355.1	1.7	Then I have to prepare for the interview tomorrow.
358.34	3.77	There's so many neurosurgeon profiles that I have to read over to prep for tomorrow.
363.53	2.41	Why is the interview with like 25 people?
367.05	1.71	None of my other interviews have been like that.
370.4	0.61	That's okay.
373.18	6.47	I hope I really like the program, it seems like it's a little bit less stressful than the other places that I've interviewed at.
380.47	1.51	It would be nice to move back to New York.
383.62	4.08	I kinda miss living in New York, I'm not sure if I wanna move back.
389.34	1.26	I definitely miss the restaurants.
392.48	3.68	I remember going out to dinner with my friend, Chase, while I was there over the summer.
398.05	4.0	That Italian place we went to was really good but the portion sizes were really small.
403.76	2.48	Whenever I order ravioli, the restaurant never gives me enough.
407.26	1.53	I need to stop ordering ravioli.
410.79	3.08	That place in Morningside Heights does really good ravioli though.
415.53	2.18	Oh, that's butternut squash ravioli.
419.31	2.12	They served it with a sage and brown butter sauce.
423.08	2.99	Maybe I'll make a sage and brown butter sauce for my ravioli tonight.
428.15	2.96	Last time I did it, the sauce got really hard and crystallized.
431.35	1.42	Maybe I used too much brown sugar.
435.04	1.04	Maybe I need more water.
437.22	1.85	If I have time, maybe I'll try to make that tonight.
441.21	4.46	Chase is sad that the Greek place closed, but honestly I thought the food was kinda bad.
446.41	1.46	I don't know why he's so sad about that.
448.77	6.74	But it didn't close, it just moved, and it only moved like 10 blocks south, uh.
456.28	4.6	I hope he finds a new good, a new good place in his restaurant, or in his neighborhood.
462.65	4.68	We could go, play, go back to New York, I'll be in New York in January.
468.09	1.23	I have to do my second looks.
471.03	4.43	Maybe I'll do a second look at Columbia and Mount Sinai, I didn't like NYU.
477.04	4.34	I don't understand why the residents talked about falling asleep at the microscope in surgery.
482.09	1.12	That was so off-putting.
483.92	4.67	I mean, I know it happens, but they shouldn't be bragging about the best way to do it to potential applicants.
490.2	1.09	That was such a bad interview.
492.6	3.18	I'm so glad none of my other interviews have asked questions like they did.
497.81	1.95	I guess I'll just reflect on their program.
501.53	3.75	I hope the interview tomorrow asks regular questions.
506.2	1.04	I don't wanna answer any more...
507.79	2.33	Any more of those silly questions that NYU asked.
512.55	3.27	Kinda wish the interview tomorrow was in person, it would be nice to be in New York.
518.16	1.72	I should text that Columbia resident.
520.55	2.42	She told me to reach out when I had interviews in New York.
524.87	4.08	I'll text her on Monday before my interview at Columbia, that would be nice.
531.35	0.63	She's nice.
532.06	1.17	It would be fun to work with her.
534.71	1.9	Although she was kinda mean to Povan.
537.5	1.38	She really, really chewed him out.
539.13	1.57	And he's only a two and he's so nice.
541.45	0.97	He didn't deserve that.
543.45	1.96	I hope she wouldn't do that to me if I went there.
547.98	2.9	All of the Hopkins residents are kinda prickly like that.
552.02	2.93	But I feel like I would be a better surgeon if I went there.
556.75	4.34	I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being productive.
563.05	3.29	I wish I knew more about what I wanted in my future career.
568.65	3.73	At least I'm confident in my specialty choice.
574.61	7.49	I guess I just need to go to a place where I have all the options to go to, to any type of practice or any subspecialty.
584.53	7.14	I didn't like Baylor, the resident I interviewed with, his eye bags were so dark, he looked so tired.
593.25	2.24	He seemed kind of sad and a little bit mean too.
597.78	1.17	Kind of reminded me of Stanford.
