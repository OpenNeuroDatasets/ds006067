2.68	7.54	So I guess I'm talking now for 10 minutes straight, which is actually pretty hard.
10.86	13.62	I don't know if too many people think about having to talk straight for 10 minutes, but it's not that easy because it's a lot of time, but I guess I'll start probably with saying some stuff about my day.
25.82	5.51	So today I woke up around 11am.
31.59	8.23	I got to sleep in pretty late today because we did not have an in-person class, which I'm very thankful for.
39.82	6.99	I'm always grateful when we don't have in-person class so I can just stay home and do what we want and live on our own schedule.
47.35	9.62	So I woke up at 11 and I wanted to go to the gym at 12 so that I could work out before coming here.
58.23	1.36	So I had about an hour.
60.95	5.27	So in that hour I watched three lectures, three online lectures.
66.59	11.57	They were about lactation because currently we're on the reproductive unit, so we're learning about the male and female reproductive unit in school.
79.56	5.92	And so the lectures today were about lactation.
88.0	20.5	They're sort of about how when a woman is pregnant and after she gives birth, the sorts of physiological changes that happen to her body, especially her breast, the breast tissue and the cells and what changes they undergo in order to produce milk and provide milk to the nursing baby.
109.27	4.81	I watched three lectures in an hour because I put them all on two times speed.
115.39	6.25	I don't know how much I retained, but our exam's on Friday, so I have to go back, do my second pass, and learn it well.
123.9	20.68	So from 11 to 11.50, I watched those, and then I went downstairs to the kitchen and I made myself a breakfast smoothie, which included banana, peanut butter, protein powder, milk, Greek yogurt, and maple syrup as a sweetener.
146.25	7.58	I think every time I swallow, because my mouth is dry, it's causing my head to move a little bit, which sucks.
153.83	1.6	I wish I didn't move my head.
155.43	9.57	But anyways, I made my breakfast smoothie, and I chugged it, and then I went to the gym, which is very close to the Kennedy Krieger Institute building.
165.0	4.67	I worked out for about an hour and 15 minutes.
172.93	9.47	The workout was not the greatest, maybe because I only had a breakfast smoothie, and maybe I should have waited until after lunch, but whatever, it's fine.
184.22	16.58	Also, another thing that caused some stress is I got an email from my advisor today that was saying how the School of Medicine has looked at my attendance record, and they found six absences.
203.2	12.82	My advisor was concerned, and he sent me an essay in the email saying how in the profession of medicine, we're supposed to make sure we're there, we're supposed to make sure that we're present.
217.38	16.12	He said how in the past, even when he's been sick with the flu or with the stomach virus, he's still made every effort to show up to work, and basically he was putting pressure on me for having missed six days.
234.32	9.75	What really annoyed me is that the School of Medicine allows seven absences per school year without any excuse.
244.89	8.53	They just give you seven days off, so that if you get sick or if you have some emergency, you can use one of your excused absences to take a day off.
254.41	12.06	I had not even used all of my allowed days off, but he was sending me an email and saying how it's irresponsible and how I should not have taken those days off.
268.2	0.99	That was irritating.
270.12	4.44	I think that was also distracting during my workout and led to a suboptimal workout.
275.34	16.64	Then I came here, and mostly I'm doing this just to make a little cash on the side, but also this seems interesting, and I also have a lot of curiosity about whether or not there's going to be any incidental finding from this MRI.
294.52	2.42	I think it's cool that I can sort of get to do this for free.
298.74	9.0	Also, I wonder if there will be anything interesting that they find out from my brain in terms of things related to the study itself.
308.34	28.44	When I think about MRIs, something that comes to mind is a couple weeks ago we learned about this case of medical error that had to do with the MRIs in which a patient in Nashville, Tennessee several years ago, she was scheduled to have an MRI, but she feels anxious about the claustrophobic nature of the MRI machine.
337.48	6.54	She asked to have an anxiolytic drug to make her feel less anxious during the MRI.
345.56	20.16	The doctor ordered an anxiolytic for her from the pharmacy, and then a nurse went in to put in the order, but when the nurse searched up the name of the drug, it didn't show up in the hospital system.
366.52	7.48	She did some manual override function to still get the drug even though it didn't show up in the system.
374.74	9.4	When she did that, she accidentally made a typo or something, and she actually ordered a really potent opioid.
384.98	13.26	Instead of giving her the anxiolytic, she gave her a much, much, much stronger dose of an opioid, and then the patient was given that drug accidentally, and then the patient was coded.
398.94	2.88	The patient went to the ICU and died the next day.
403.32	8.84	Because of that, the nurse was actually fired from her job, and there was a huge controversy throughout the nation about this.
412.68	11.66	Because most of the times in cases of medical error, the nurses and the doctors involved aren't actually punished that much.
425.32	5.0	That's in order to incentivize them being honest and reporting their error in the future.
430.46	10.5	But in this case, the nurse was fired, and then the city district of Nashville, the district attorney actually sued the nurse.
442.3	10.76	This created a lot of backlash from the medical community that were coming out in defense of the nurse and saying how we should not punish cases of medical error so strongly.
454.32	11.0	Because if we punish them, it will create a motive for future errors where the nurses and doctors will lie and say there was no error, even when there was.
466.2	5.12	So yeah, when I think of an MRI, that story comes to mind.
471.42	8.5	But anyways, after this MRI, I'm going to walk home, and during my walk I'll probably listen to a podcast.
480.94	2.82	Maybe I'll listen to the Daily from the New York Times.
485.32	4.78	I hope that the podcast today has something to do with the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
491.02	13.3	A lot of times I get my news from podcasts, so I want to know more about the details of what happened I understand a lot of people died, so hopefully there's a podcast about it that I can listen to on my walk home.
505.32	2.12	And when I get home, I'm going to eat lunch.
507.94	2.26	It's going to be a really late lunch, but that's fine.
510.82	4.5	I'm going to eat lunch with my roommate, and we're going to watch a TV show that we've been watching together lately.
516.32	2.34	It's called The Legends of Vox Machina.
519.98	1.47	It's an animated show.
522.41	0.67	It's like an action-adventure.
523.08	2.82	It's sort of like Avatar The Last Airbender.
526.31	0.95	We've been enjoying it a lot.
527.64	4.68	Usually we eat meals together, and then we watch shows together.
533.24	4.08	So after I do that, then I'm going to go back to finishing up the lectures for the day.
538.16	5.08	I have about one hour left of lecture, which is really 30 minutes, because I'm going to watch it at 2x speed.
544.26	6.78	So after watching the lectures, I'm going to start studying for our exam on Friday.
551.8	2.16	And that's probably what's going to happen the rest of the day.
555.32	2.42	Until at night.
558.23	2.83	At night I usually call my girlfriend before I go to sleep.
561.96	6.36	Unfortunately, we're doing medium distance relationship right now, because she lives in Washington, D.C.
569.1	8.02	So we only see each other on the weekends, but on the weeknights we try to call before we go to sleep.
577.8	4.54	And so when I call her, I'm going to tell her everything I just said, basically about my whole day.
583.32	5.7	And I'm also going to tell her about this MRI situation and what went on here.
590.0	1.84	Hopefully something interesting happens.
592.56	3.06	And I'm also excited to see what happens with the web browser test.
596.54	4.78	After I talk to her, then I'm going to go to sleep.
