9.18	3.77	Umm, so today it was really cold in my room.
13.3	3.22	It was really hot in the middle of the night, I kind of just like woke up.
17.71	3.22	And the heater was like on blast and I was really hot.
21.02	10.87	I was sweating and I... Which is probably messed up 'cause I fell asleep in like a long sleeved and my hoodie and my sweats but that's 'cause it was really cold last night when I was walking back to my dorm.
32.83	5.6	I was supposed to go study with Jesenia for my class for the psych final that we have tonight.
38.53	7.39	But we ended up just watching like Wednesday and the Adams family, we really didn't do anything but paint our nails.
46.21	7.48	And I went to sleep at like at 1:00 and I woke up this morning tired but I had to come to the MRI scan.
54.83	3.92	So I told Zion I was gonna come and then it was so cold this morning too.
59.59	1.73	Jesenia pulled an all nighter with my friend.
62.56	6.15	But I'm just excited to go home to be honest 'cause my flight's right after the Psych final and I can finally go home.
70.29	2.88	And then I still have to get Christmas presents for my family back home.
73.18	6.77	But I decided not to get them until I'm back home because taking them would be a pain in the airplane and stuff.
81.24	5.4	I don't know what to give my little brothers 'cause there's... Two of them are too small to play with anything but toys.
86.74	2.58	But they have a lot of toys so I don't want to get them more toys.
91.85	9.31	Matthew turned seven in the beginning of December, so I don't know if I should get him a Christmas/birthday present or just like a Christmas present.
102.05	8.28	But I've been using a lot of money from my account because I've been buying so much stuff for people here and then when I go home it's even more money.
111.02	5.4	But I'm just glad that classes are almost over, well, classes are over.
116.43	3.66	I mean like the tests are almost over because I'm ready to go home.
121.72	5.9	I'm kind of nervous with the psych exam 'cause last time I didn't do good even though I knew most of the topic.
127.77	5.15	It was kind of just, it was really annoying, the questions really trip people up.
135.25	8.62	But I want to go home and it's really cold outside to be honest so I'm wearing two socks.
145.26	8.07	Me and my friends did like a Secret Santa thing and we gave each other gifts and that was pretty cool, the gifts we got each other were really thoughtful.
154.32	6.74	I wish my other friends could join but they said they weren't able to be able to join for Secret Santa.
161.95	6.3	And I wanna be able to umm, to get them, we got them gifts too but I wish they were able to get us something.
171.52	13.13	I haven't been working this weekend even though I probably should have but it's probably 'cause I had so much work to do before going home and I still haven't even packed my stuff.
185.24	6.49	I still have to do laundry even though I literally leave in like 10 hours, I really should do laundry.
194.75	3.97	My room is not even a mess, I just didn't make my bed before I left like I usually do.
205.16	12.09	I wonder what I should wear to be honest 'cause I'm going to Paris and it's supposed to be really cold over there but like I'm used to the cold but I just don't like the cold and it's hard to dress nice in the cold.
217.35	6.89	But since I'm going home I really should use some of my clothes that I have there because they're nicer than the ones I have here.
224.63	3.07	Cause I just go to classes here like, it's boring.
228.74	4.71	And then I still have to do the volunteering for HCC.
234.99	9.51	Yeah, that's really tiring because it's online but I want to go home but I still have to volunteer even if it's online.
245.94	2.42	And then when I come back I have to volunteer in person.
248.61	1.14	It's like I never get a break from them.
255.6	4.56	Being an adult is hard, I wish people prepared us for being an adult, it's so much work.
267.04	4.51	I thought it was still on the screen, well, not at all, it's like across, I don't know if I should keep talking or not.
280.25	1.61	The screen is like gray and has lines, it's pretty boring to look up.
284.04	5.94	There's like a little camera at the top, I remember the first time I got an MRI it was not like this at all.
289.99	4.16	It was like a bigger machine and it was louder. This is kind of quiet.
296.48	2.42	It is colder in this room than it was in that hospital.
302.42	1.14	I just want to go home.
304.85	0.49	I'm just tired.
307.97	4.26	I'm low-key debating if I should just go back to my room after this and take a nap.
312.92	5.8	But I really have to pack and do laundry 'cause my clothes are dirty and I should probably study for my test.
319.56	3.18	But I don't know what to do.
322.75	0.98	I just wanna go home.
325.71	1.53	I just wanna go take it and leave.
329.13	2.47	But I should care about my grades more, to be honest.
336.61	10.21	I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk for the whole 10 minutes, or... 'cause I think it was supposed to be only like 120 seconds, not 10 minutes.
347.95	1.59	It'd be a long time to talk about something.
352.96	8.03	I'm supposed to wash my hair too, it's really puffy and it's hard to move it around 'cause it's really puffy.
366.09	1.44	Jesenia also comes later.
368.52	2.23	She, she's also coming here to get MRI.
371.64	1.98	She's taking the Jimmy, I don't know what she's doing now.
373.77	1.19	Like we've never taken it.
375.21	1.33	Taking the Jimmy would be annoying.
378.97	1.74	She should just take a Lyft like I did.
384.42	3.82	There was so much traffic this morning for no reason, I was almost late.
395.12	0.65	I'm hungry.
396.02	0.64	I wanna go eat.
400.82	3.87	I woke up and came straight here so I haven't eaten anything.
406.47	1.29	I just wanna go eat.
408.1	1.19	You wish you got THB.
411.13	4.26	They're pretty good, although last time I got it was not that good.
416.08	1.09	They messed up my sandwich.
444.72	11.5	I am not sure if I'm supposed to talk the whole time 'cause the cross is still in the center of the screen but I haven't heard anything so I will just stop talking 'cause it's been a long time.
474.55	4.26	I have these cool socks on right now that I got from Chri... That I got for my Secret Santa.
479.3	4.66	They're pink and they have like Santa Claus on them but his butt is out.
484.85	1.84	My friends like to do stuff like that.
486.7	2.27	Like every time we give each other gifts they're kind of weird.
490.8	6.54	She also got me gel nail polish, which I used last night but it peeled off this morning so it was pretty weird.
499.72	9.51	Like when I was filling out the form, the the nail polish was just like chipping away even though it's gel.
509.28	3.07	It was pretty annoying 'cause I painted it last night.
513.0	0.84	I'll have to do it again.
518.25	2.48	And I have like a lot of dirty clothes.
520.78	8.62	I don't even know what's in there 'cause I swear I don't change clothes that often but at the same time it is three weeks of laundry so maybe that's why.
531.77	3.92	And so it's probably a lot.
536.83	1.58	I have a lot of socks to be honest.
538.42	2.92	And I just keep buying more 'cause my feet get cold.
541.35	1.37	I tend to wear two pairs.
545.1	5.3	And my, my friend's family who's from Baltimore, his family got me a lot of nice gifts.
550.5	1.64	It's kinda, it threw me off.
552.24	7.88	Like I went to the store with them so I can buy something and they got me all these stuff and I was like, uh, what am I supposed to do with this?
560.41	0.75	Like it was really weird.
563.53	11.2	My mom also is getting me my Christmas presents but she doesn't know what to get me because like almost everything she got me is like sold out.
575.08	1.39	So now she doesn't know what to get me.
578.1	2.92	Cause she usually gets whatever I put on the Christmas list.
581.97	10.25	But since everything I asked for apparently was sold out, it was like, it was like hard to get it for me.
593.11	3.17	I wonder what she got my brother Edward because he always asks for nice stuff.
596.98	2.82	He'll always be forcing it, yeah.
