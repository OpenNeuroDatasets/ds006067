4.82	8.54	Umm, so I think uh, this morning I woke up and I generally talk to my parents.
13.39	8.87	My parents uh, live in India, so whenever I wake up and then right before I go to sleep, I generally like video call them and talk to them.
23.05	2.22	And this morning I did that.
25.47	5.13	So my, I have a twin sister who also just got done with her semester.
30.73	5.53	She's at Berkeley and she sort of reached home before me, so she's now at home.
37.08	10.99	So they were all at home today and we talked for about some time before umm, I had to sort of start getting ready to come here for the study.
48.77	12.93	And yeah, then I walked from my house, which is, I live in the social, I walk from there to the Gilman tunnel then we, we got here and I'm really excited about the study.
62.07	5.49	And then after I get done with this, I'm just got to go home and relax for some time.
68.06	2.21	And I also need to finish some of my packing.
71.23	6.13	Umm, I'm almost done with my packing, but I think, yeah, there's a few things left that I need to do.
78.25	11.58	Umm, I've been have meaning to sort of... Uh, yeah, so basically when I had to submit my tax refund in April, I think, yeah, 18th April is when it was due.
90.33	24.32	And I did submit it at that time and my umm, state tax refund had come but my federal one hadn't come and recently I got the federal and be then I got a another letter from the state tax people that there was like a miscalculation in my taxes and I have to pay more, which is really funny because I thought I would get refund and now I have to pay more taxes.
115.24	4.97	Umm, but yeah, so I have to sort of get a check made in the bank for that.
120.22	3.59	So I went to bank yesterday, and got that done.
125.5	3.84	Yeah, and tomorrow I might go to the Christmas village with my friend.
130.27	4.13	Uh, and after that I'm just going to relax for most of the day.
134.5	9.1	Then my flight is on the 23rd in the morning at 10:00 AM. And we're going to be Ubering, I am going to be ride sharing with another person.
143.97	2.81	Because we have to go to IAD, which is really far away.
147.14	7.42	Umm, so that Uber is also troublingly expensive, but uh, yeah, we're gonna sort of go together.
154.72	1.89	But I have a lot of suitcases.
156.71	2.51	I have like two big suitcases and one small one.
159.39	3.34	So I'm a little anxious who has a big suitcase and small one.
162.74	3.26	So I am a little nervous as to whether it will fit in the Uber or not.
166.47	2.31	Umm, but I hope everything goes well.
169.55	3.57	I mostly sleep the entire time during the flight.
173.78	9.3	And so the good thing about that is when I get home I don't really feel jet lagged because I've slept my entire flight and so I can stay awake.
183.77	10.23	Umm, and I'm going to be when I reach uh India, it's going be the daytime there so I think I'll need to stay awake if I need to get umm, you know, not be jet lag.
194.73	13.5	Umm, but yeah, I think the past few days I've been, uh, you know, I've been able to relax and that was most needed because this process I was taking a course called NLP, which is Natural Language Processing.
208.53	6.71	And so four credit course in the CS department and it was literally the bane of my existence.
215.34	2.65	Umm, that is also an understatement.
218.22	4.77	But yeah, my entire semester I thought it would be like a chill semester for me.
223.15	6.42	But that course was so much work, so much work that literally took over my entire life.
229.8	3.28	Uh, that was the last final I had to give to.
233.64	6.92	And that was on the 19th. And so I think it was more torturous because I had so much time to prepare for it.
240.99	7.28	And I still knew that uh, I would have to work on it because no matter how much studied it was gonna be a really hard paper.
248.73	10.26	Umm, but yeah, this Monday, uh, we had our final from 6:00 to 9:00 PM and that is not usually the time I'm my most attentive, uh, self.
259.25	3.01	So I was really nervous about having to take the exam at that time.
262.96	9.43	Umm, the paper was truly comical, I mean, I really don't know what I, what I wrote on the paper, but I'm so glad that it's done.
273.35	5.26	I think the saving grace about that class was that the professor was really nice and engaging.
278.84	8.01	And so, umm, you know, it as feels good to know... And, and I think he also acknowledged the fact that the course was quite difficult.
287.31	12.38	And so we were like you know to quote, actually someone had said on Piazza we were a group of, you know, fellow survivors of this class, of this soul crushing class, which actually it always felt soul crushing.
300.91	10.86	Umm, yeah. And so we like at the end of the class, like the last day of classes we all take a picture s-sort of be able to look up, look back at the picture, and know that, you know, all of us got through this class.
312.53	4.43	Um. And then at the day of the exam the professor like got donuts for all of us.
317.13	13.5	And initially when I was like writing the exam I thought that you know people will take the donuts after the exam is over but then I started seeing people, you know, started taking the donuts in the middle of the exam.
331.52	1.56	And I think I ended up doing that too.
333.26	6.6	Because after some point I was like there's there's no point trying to think more. Umm, because there's no hope.
339.99	4.44	So I also went ahead and took a donut with them, you know, so I worked on the rest of exam.
344.44	1.94	So, it was it was it was much needed.
346.51	2.05	You know, it was a source of happiness during the exam.
349.29	5.03	But yeah, overall this semester I think was pretty nice.
355.15	8.77	Umm, the classes that I took were kinda intense, but I, I took this, I took this other class called Multidisciplinary Design.
364.02	12.34	Where like work with students from like different majors and you're paired with like a third party organization and you have to, uh, basically solve a problem that they're working on.
376.82	20.98	And we were working with this company called, CoabTech, they make, like, short term feeding tubes and checking the placement of those feeding tubes has been an issue, like, it's not reliable, and so they're trying to come up with another method, uh, to check whether the tube has been placed in the stomach versus not in the stomach.
398.33	1.62	And so we were just working on that problem.
399.99	9.06	And I think the majority of the semester we felt kind of lost because, you know, there was not one definitive solution that we are able to think about.
409.15	10.0	But then towards the end of the semester, I think usually pulled through like some of the people on our team were able to do some testing, like we as team...
419.34	9.24	So basically our solution that we came up was like attaching the pH sensor to the end of the tube to check the pH um at the end of the guidewire.
428.94	3.34	And so it was in the stomach since the stomach has like acidic fluid.
432.61	6.56	The sensor will be able to detect. And so our first step was sort of to buy the sensor and calibrate it.
439.18	4.98	And we as a team were able to calibrate the sensor, make it work, which I thought was a big achievement in itself.
444.72	9.9	Um, but then towards the end when we had to like submit our design doc and give our presentation, some of our team members were able to, you know, do some more extensive testing with the sensor.
454.63	3.07	And so I think we really pulled through in the end thanks to them.
458.75	3.28	And so I feel pretty confident, this is a two semester course.
462.04	7.7	So like the first semester we mostly just learn about design principles and start thinking about what we want to build.
470.34	5.39	And the second semester, which is the upcoming semester, we actually have to like, you know, build the prototype.
476.23	2.78	And so I'm actually kinda really excited about building the prototype.
479.27	11.65	Um, and yeah, just sort of going through the different iterations of how to make a pH sensor work within the environment that we think can exist in the stomach.
491.41	5.86	Reading up about the stomach environment, what we should be looking for when using the pH sensor.
498.46	3.15	Uh, I think we're gonna try out like more sensors as well.
502.3	8.61	So yeah, I think, uh, like a pressure sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor, so I think it's gonna be, you know, really fun.
512.36	14.69	Um, apart from that, I think there, as I said, like my sister is, you know, at home now and she's graduating a semester early, so she has actually graduated.
527.25	15.02	So I think a lot of, I've, you know, she recently did her like graduation photo shoot and so I was looking at the pictures and makes me sort of uh stress-less about the fact that I have one more semester to go.
542.37	13.17	I just, you know, want to be done, uh you know, finally like get a long break where I really don't have to do much. I think I have sort of [0:09:44.7] ____ where I don't feel like doing anything.
556.34	5.42	Um, really excited to go back and see my family.
562.29	2.35	I'm going back home after a year.
565.21	12.84	Um, and even though my parents sort of came to visit us over the summer for my, me and my sister's birthday, it was our 21st birthday, they came um and lived here for like a week.
578.67	2.35	But I haven't seen my grandparents in year.
581.09	2.91	And so I'm really excited to go back home and meet everyone.
584.66	1.56	And my cousins are also coming.
586.35	15.55	My first cousins, both of, they also, both of them also live here, but they're also coming back for like, one of them has their winter break and one of them is just coming because she had attend wedding and since we, all of us are coming, so she's just decided to come as well.
