2.21	4.4	So, I am starting this ThinkAloud.
8.49	9.86	I'm not quite sure why the MRI machine needs to be so beepy, because it's just supposed to be scanning my brain, but it's just beeping.
19.49	1.74	But I guess that's what it does.
21.65	11.76	Also, I don't really understand this, what I'm looking at, because I'm in the tube, but then also there's like a mirror on this visor that kind of shows me outside the tube, which is kind of cool.
34.59	2.0	I don't know where the TV is actually.
36.69	6.8	I think it's above my head, or it may be by my feet, but I can't check because I can't move.
43.63	4.06	Otherwise, the ThinkAloud is going pretty well.
48.79	1.7	It's kind of cold in my hands.
50.95	3.96	I feel some breeze, and that's all right.
55.85	2.34	But overall, it's been going pretty well.
60.07	2.83	Today, I'm actually feeling pretty hungry,
62.95	3.48	because I didn't eat that much food before I came here.
68.15	5.24	I had some eggs, but that obviously wasn't enough food for me.
74.81	3.34	I wonder if I'll ever feel tired during this experiment,
78.79	2.4	because this is honestly pretty comfortable.
82.27	0.91	I could just lay down and fall asleep.
83.42	4.97	But I wonder what the MRI would say, or the brain scan would say if I fell asleep.
89.15	2.2	But that probably won't happen.
95.71	1.13	Looking at this plus sign, it's kind of blurry,
96.87	9.76	so I don't know if it's my eyes that are bad, or it's the actual thing, but maybe I need a new eye check or something.
106.75	7.56	Also this mic is falling onto my mouth, so it's getting kind of itchy, but I'll power it through.
115.31	6.44	I'm hoping I'm not moving my head too much, but I'm just talking, and I don't know.
121.85	5.9	I hope it's not moving too much for the results.
131.01	2.42	Also, today was the first day I took the JHMI.
134.15	0.8	Actually, not the first day.
134.99	2.32	I haven't taken it in a long time, like a freshman year.
137.63	5.98	But I took the JHMI, and the JHMI is actually pretty nice.
143.63	3.62	I haven't been to that campus in a while, so it was nice coming here.
148.69	9.97	I'm really glad I signed up for this study, because I was told about this study from my friend, and he said it would be really fun,
158.74	1.17	so I was like, might as well do it.
159.93	2.4	I have nothing better to do.
163.89	0.06	I'm a senior now, so I think I have more time on my hands, more free time on my hands, since I'm taking less classes than I normally do.
171.64	9.27	So, I thought it would be fun to do stuff that I normally wouldn't have time to do, like when I focus on schoolwork and stuff.
181.29	4.72	So, I think this SSJ will be pretty fun, because I don't really have any other obligations or schoolwork.
187.39	3.16	I don't have too much schoolwork to worry on.
192.85	6.86	I haven't been doing too much stuff though, but just watching Netflix.
203.33	4.94	I started watching more of this show called Invincible with my friend, but I haven't gotten to finish it.
211.13	3.6	I wonder how long it's been since I started talking.
215.21	7.14	Maybe like four minutes, five minutes, but we'll see.
223.95	5.28	Also, the little grips, the little buttons I'm pressing, I'm not pressing them, but I feel them.
229.39	5.28	I'm pretty sure the left one is right, I mean the left one is yes, and the right one is no.
236.77	13.56	I'm hoping later on in the study that when I hear the story, I won't exactly, I will actually pay attention enough and remember what happens in the story.
252.33	5.78	Also, I've been thinking a lot about the overall purpose of this study.
261.41	7.24	From what I read, it seemed like I was, or you guys were measuring something about my brain as time progresses.
270.77	5.0	So, I guess maybe something to do with how we had two stories and then I have to recall the first one.
276.93	1.7	So, I'm not too sure about that.
279.31	10.68	But at the end of the study, I think it would be cool to learn more about my brain, or learn more about what the overall purpose of the study is.
291.55	7.0	Now the mic is entirely on my mouth, so I hope that's not too big of a deal.
301.29	6.82	And I have a small itch on my back, but there's no way I can ever itch that, so that's just going to have to go away now.
316.89	1.92	Oh, after this I'm going to go back to school.
319.33	1.1	I have one class today.
321.41	11.14	The one class I have is at 4.30, so kind of awkward on a Friday to have to go by one class at 4.30, but it's a cool class.
333.19	8.36	It's a class about software engineering, so probably the class I'm most interested in for this semester.
343.87	2.82	But since it's at 4:30, I kind of don't want to go to it.
348.11	2.9	But I have to be a good student.
352.67	13.64	Now I'm thinking that this visor-beard thing is pointing towards my head, so that the monitor is actually near my head and not my feet, because otherwise I'd be able to see my feet.
368.25	14.63	I think this visor thing may be the best part of an MRI, because otherwise people would see staring at the tube, inside the tube, and then they would feel claustrophobic.
382.88	8.25	But when you have the visor, and when you have the mirror, it just seems like you're looking outside, so you can't really tell that you're in a tube.
394.89	5.78	I was nervous earlier, I feel like I'm getting more or less nervous about the whole thing.
403.37	0.86	It's kind of relaxing.
406.07	4.76	I'm also used to the beeping sound now, so no problems here.
412.07	1.9	But I still wonder why there's the beeping.
416.19	4.12	Couldn't they make an MRI machine that still scans but doesn't have to beep?
421.79	4.14	Or is it necessary to beep for the person inside to know that they're being scanned?
430.41	1.4	I wonder how long it's been now.
433.57	2.66	It's probably like seven minutes, or eight.
443.63	1.04	My weekend plans?
445.89	1.62	Not sure exactly what I'm going to do.
448.33	1.5	My roommates are not back yet.
451.07	0.2	I have six of them.
451.27	0.42	Or five.
452.45	0.74	Five other roommates.
453.19	0.96	We have six people in the house.
454.91	3.14	But three of them are gone, because they already graduated this semester.
458.09	1.12	So, they're not coming.
459.47	6.5	Well, they graduated last semester, so they're not coming back until later this week, or later this month, or some of them.
468.05	2.86	So, I'm excited to see them when they come back.
471.75	1.14	Maybe when they come back.
473.05	1.36	They're coming back on Sunday, so.
474.73	5.28	Or some of them are coming back on Sunday, so we'll see what we can do then.
481.43	2.62	Otherwise, I just have two other roommates with me right now.
484.37	1.4	So, the house feels a little empty.
486.83	9.58	Usually, I kind of got used to having a lot of people in the house around, so this is a nice change to only have a couple people.
497.25	3.88	Also, I just felt something move, but I don't know if that was real or not.
510.67	0.36	I don't know if I actually moved or not.
511.99	1.04	Oh, I was talking about the roommates.
513.13	0.6	But yeah, they'll come back eventually.
527.05	6.03	Thinking about how a lot of companies are laying off people.
533.08	4.21	So, I wonder how my future will be in those companies.
537.39	4.12	Especially because I'm going into a tech field.
542.33	2.18	I'm a CS major, so I'm going into a tech field.
544.61	5.4	But all these companies are laying off people, so I wonder how long...
550.25	2.32	I wonder how that'll go after I start working.
553.17	1.88	But I will be working in New York.
555.59	1.04	So that seems pretty fun.
558.15	3.87	A lot of my friends are actually going to New York too.
562.02	8.49	So, working in the city plus a lot of my friends being there is probably going to be a really good time.
572.29	6.0	My girlfriend actually isn't moving to New York, or she's trying to, but isn't able to at the moment, so that's kind of sad.
578.47	4.8	But hopefully she's able to move in the future.
588.57	6.3	If she does, it'll be great because all my friends and hers are also there.
598.09	2.36	But the rent in New York is actually too expensive.
