-10.27	4.41	So, my first time in an MRI.
-5.1	11.28	It's loud, it's reminding meâ€“ First time in an MRI.
6.38	19.3	It's loud, it's reminding me of the crosswalk signaling stuff in Australia, where it's just some rapid-fire beeping noises.
29.04	5.94	Now I'm thinking it sounds like some sort of machine gun.
38.09	10.64	Like war movies, I'm thinking about war movies now like All Quiet on the Western Front, which recently won a couple of Oscars.
49.54	11.62	I'm still super happy about the fact that Everything Everywhere All at Once won so many Oscars.
62.3	6.46	Michelle Yeoh is a legend, super exciting.
69.77	10.03	I'm feeling happy and proud that there's a lot more Asian-American representation in Hollywood.
82.98	3.96	I'm thinking about LA now, how I went to undergrad there.
90.0	4.3	I'm wishing I could go back for residency.
95.38	9.08	So, I'm thinking about applying for residencies in a little over a year.
106.72	20.92	Now, I'm thinking about rotations and seeing my roommates who are on their surgery rotation and super busy, waking up at 4 or 5 am, headed to the hospital, doing pre-rounds and then rounds.
128.23	8.59	I'm comparing that to what I'm currently doing now, which is just studying for my Step 1 exam.
139.7	8.79	I'm thinking about all the different subjects I still have to review later this afternoon, as well as the following weeks.
148.51	6.53	I think I have a little over four weeks left over to study.
157.98	13.42	A lot of the renal stuff I need to study, because all the tubules and transporters, that's a lot of stuff to review.
171.69	7.83	Like all the ions, sodium, potassium, chloride.
180.7	6.92	I'm thinking about surgery now, how I still need to practice suturing.
188.46	9.24	Dr. Wong, my mentor, bless her for letting me practice suturing in her OR with her.
199.58	9.92	Now, I'm remembering that I should probably reach out to her and ask about our case report that we wrote a couple of weeks, months ago.
218.6	0.31	I haven't heard back about that in a while.
218.94	4.56	Now, I'm thinking about the resident, Andrew, how he's forwarded me the email
223.53	5.29	about the presentation that's coming up in Chicago in over a month.
230.1	1.14	I need to prepare that.
231.47	5.37	I need to prepare a couple of other posters that are coming up in the next couple of weeks.
238.62	12.64	The co-care center I worked with, now I'm remembering I need to work on fixing that part of the animation and resending the video clip to Molly.
256.27	9.67	I need to finish my art projects on my iPad, which I forgot to bring today, so I'll probably work on that later in the evening.
268.22	10.26	Also, I need to probably head to the grocery store sometime tomorrow, to cook for the week and get some more groceries.
280.2	3.66	I'm running out on vegetables and fruits.
286.44	5.86	I'm probably going to get some asparagus, I've got to get that fiber in me.
294.14	13.02	I'm thinking about the time I had asparagus right before my spring break, how I had to finish all of that in one night because I didn't want to waste any and toss some.
308.28	6.55	Now, I'm thinking about the last couple of weeks where I was in Portugal.
314.98	1.49	Super fun but rainy.
318.2	10.02	I should have followed the other group's itinerary and gone to Porto first, because it was less rainy when they were there, compared to us.
330.6	4.22	Now, I'm thinking about my next trips.
337.01	7.71	I need to reach out to my cousin about meeting up with her in Amsterdam and figure out all my Berlin stuff,
344.87	6.25	but I should probably do that after a couple more hours of studying and stuff.
352.72	4.03	Now, I'm thinking about how the Step exam is at 8:30 am.
357.89	15.49	And I'm trying to fix my sleeping schedule so that it matches up, so I won't be too tired or awake at 8:30 am or just 8 am for that exam.
375.18	7.22	Now, I'm thinking about my friend's wedding that I'll get to go to after my exam.
383.56	1.72	I'm thinking about my parents.
385.65	1.17	Get to see them for a while.
386.84	1.84	Haven't seen them in a couple of months.
389.1	10.3	I'm excited to go back to Sierra Nevada, see some nice trees and mountains.
399.5	6.92	Because thinking about how the mountains here are, they aren't really mountains, they're more like hills.
407.24	8.86	I'm excited for Lake Tahoe, thinking about the lakes, the trees, like summer cabin vibes.
416.7	3.62	Trying to figure out what to wear.
420.44	4.03	My suit, I might just wear my typical navy suit.
424.64	5.94	But also, I might switch it up a little bit, accessorize a little bit.
433.74	7.72	I'm thinking about what I should give my friend for his wedding, or and her, because I'm friends with both of them.
446.48	4.8	Maybe some resin coasters, I'm not sure.
453.44	5.52	Now, I'm wondering where he went for residency, where he matched for residency, because he was applying this past year.
460.12	2.73	I should probably reach out to him and ask,
464.2	2.36	which I think I did, but I don't know if he responded.
466.69	2.69	I'll probably ask Lindsey later.
471.8	5.05	Thinking about New York now, how she's in New York, I think,
476.92	3.3	or maybe she's back in California.
482.68	9.66	Probably, I need to remind myself to text her later because I'm headed up to New York in a couple of weeks, just for different scenery for studying.
493.54	9.86	I'm thinking about the different places in New York where I've been to, like the Jenga building and the new bean that's underneath, which isn't like the real bean.
503.84	1.34	I'm thinking about Chicago.
505.25	4.05	I'm going to head there in over a month for that conference.
509.6	5.5	I'm excited to see my high school friend at D2 again.
516.04	6.7	I'm thinking about the funds, I'm thinking about how Dr. Cohen is going to cover my expenses.
522.82	13.46	I need to figure out how to get that reimbursed later, especially for the Lyft or Uber rides to and from the airport and from his place to the convention center.
538.12	9.68	Now, I'm thinking about how my presentation is right smack in the middle of the medical student forum, where Dr. Clayton is going to be at.
547.86	9.56	So, I'll probably sit in the back so that I can leave and then come back after my presentation.
559.16	3.82	I'm thinking about last year's med student forum.
563.64	6.74	That was very male-dominated, which was interesting, but I guess it's reflective of the field.
572.16	8.74	Trying to think about how I can connect and network with other med students at this conference.
580.97	6.29	I'm excited to meet Munso at the conference.
587.46	2.6	We've been talking on Instagram for a while.
590.18	3.14	I've seen her art, it's pretty inspiring.
596.55	1.28	Got to work on my art.
