3.01	9.26	Okay so I know that squinting my eyes makes my eyesight worse but I literally can’t read unless I squint
12.27	3.18	but I saw the begin sign so I’m just gonna start talking
16.45	5.67	But like I kinda like forced myself to think about things cause right now I’m not really thinking about anything
23.12	5.85	Umm it’s a lot more crammed than I remembered it to be in freshman year
30.07	3.0	Umm but I honestly don’t remember because it was like two years ago
33.88	3.66	But I felt really bad because they paid like a lot
38.35	4.72	but they kept like trying to say like, “oh Ashley you have uh can you try to stay awake?” and I’m like “yea yea yea”
43.5	4.12	but then during the exercise I was falling asleep because it was like so boring and it was like so late
48.3	4.99	Well it wasn’t that late but I was like really tired from like doing like just having school and stuff
53.95	1.36	But at least I got an image of the brain
56.8	2.13	And then my brain is lopsided like it’s like
59.48	8.84	I think my right side of the brain is like more like it’s like s- it’s like dented or something I think my head is dented
68.93	3.46	Yea my head is definitely dented because my mo-
72.39	2.77	I would like love to sleep on my right side when I was a baby
75.16	1.98	but then my mom like didn’t really fix it
77.59	0.74	Or she tried to
78.33	2.8	but then I would just go back to like being on the right side again
83.71	2.61	Yea that’s why my ear is also like kind of messed up
86.32	2.74	because after trying to sleep on the right side
90.01	2.43	But then like when they think about my lopsided brain
92.44	6.19	I think about the the protests the Chinese international kids at our school
99.26	3.09	I think it’s because I posted like both pictures on my finsta at the same time
103.18	2.55	But thinking about it makes me like like it’s so funny
105.73	7.11	because the representatives from Hong Kong came to Hopkins to talk about what was it?
113.2	5.08	Umm oh yea it was to talk about like how Hong Kong like having independence from China and stuff like that
118.74	8.07	And then in the back like Chinese international kids would be holding up signs and like protesting against it and just like yelling at the speakers like I was like “oh my god”
127.58	1.86	And then I’m really glad I got a picture with them
129.44	1.18	because they looked so funny
132.36	7.44	Umm I’m really excited to go to the Roe v. Wade protest in D.C. next Monday
140.52	1.77	Yea it’s Monday for fourth of July
143.33	1.09	Umm I hope it’s during the day
144.42	1.86	cause at night I kinda wanna hang out with Daniel
147.39	5.12	But like where do you where does one get a cardboard to write a sign on?
153.15	3.81	Like Annie says that it’s gonna be at CVS but I don’t think CVS sells cardboards
157.82	4.9	Or if they do like it’s going to be really overpriced like CVS like overprices everything it’s so annoying
163.46	1.95	And they also give you like a million coupons
165.41	2.05	but like it’s all it’s already overpriced
167.46	1.76	so I would rather just go to Giant
170.76	4.14	I know Daniel ha- I I hope he has like a lot of leftover cardboard boxes
174.9	4.8	cause I would rather like recycle those than like buy a cardboard box myself
180.4	2.54	But then again like what would I even write on there?
183.75	4.89	Umm I see so many creative signs on like Instagram and TikTok
188.64	3.59	but I don’t know what I’m gonna be holding up when I’m protesting
193.14	4.63	But like the more I think about Roe v. Wade the more mad I get like I think I’ve said this to so like many people
198.49	6.34	But like I feel so bad for people who like can’t get it in their own state
204.83	3.05	and they have to like drive for hours to get it legalized
208.42	10.2	Like on TikTok like the guy like who founded Planned Parenthood he said like it just makes abortion more dangerous people are still going to get it
219.09	3.45	Like why can’t people just like understand that?
223.65	4.9	I like it just uh sometimes like it makes me so mad living here
229.5	5.94	But also you America is like much better than South Korea cause there they’re like super sexist and racist
236.32	1.77	Oh I can’t live there I ca-
239.7	1.74	Like going to Korea is like fun
242.44	2.88	but like to live there like I can’t imagine
246.52	2.25	Yea I think like last time I went there like I
248.77	9.0	I think from now on I’ll only do like a month when I visit but then I’ll only visit for family and stuff like not for anything else
259.54	2.2	I don’t know what I wanted to eat for dinner today
261.74	3.36	because I asked I asked Daniel if he wants to go to Fells Point
265.1	2.33	but like I don’t know what’s up with that kid
268.36	5.76	Like I really want to go to Pitango and get the the hazelnut and pistachio flavor
274.12	0.81	because they’re so good
275.18	12.2	But they’re so expensive like I remember when like they used to charge a small cup for like five dollars and something but now it’s freakin like seven dollars or something or like eight dollars
288.1	6.1	Like I feel like that’s so overpriced for just like I mean it’s like good it’s like really good gelato but like it’s so overpriced
294.88	1.86	But the matcha latte is so good
297.37	2.41	Matcha latte is only four dollars and twenty-five cents
300.7	1.68	And I I also got my paycheck today
302.93	3.08	But why is tax in Maryland so so much?
306.53	6.35	Like I was expecting to like get paid but then like I’m getting paid like seventy five percent of what I was expecting to get paid
313.42	2.74	But then like Daniel says I can get it like a tax return
316.16	2.5	but I don’t even know how to do tax returns
318.66	4.4	so I have to ask my dad but I don’t even know if like I like he know how to do I’m pretty sure he knows how to do it
323.87	2.88	But then like why does TIAA keep sending me mails?
326.75	6.51	Like my retirement plan like I didn’t even know I had a retirement plan
333.85	2.49	But I think like Carnegie is just doing it for me
337.34	2.72	But then like does that mean I get all the money when I retire?
340.7	3.45	Also like how am I supposed to know what kind of retirement plan I’m having?
345.05	3.72	Like does that mean some part of my wage is going into my retirement plan
350.18	2.49	I should probably get my credit card then
353.26	2.95	It’s kind of like credit score it’s like it keeps building up
357.08	2.4	And I applied for a credit card like a long time ago
359.48	1.69	but then they’re still not sending me it
362.55	2.22	I should probably do that today
366.29	4.08	Also I have to do pilot office hours later today at like six
371.0	1.77	But does that mean I can’t get dinner here?
374.0	1.32	Maybe I’ll just get dessert here
375.32	1.99	and then like go back home to do office hours
377.76	2.81	And I have so much laundry to do before Amy comes tomorrow
382.11	1.01	I have so much laundry
383.12	4.57	why does my laundry machine take like four hours to do a single batch of laundry?
388.46	3.22	Also when it comes out like the clothes are not even dry it’s like kind of damp
393.72	5.3	Like I I can’t even use dryer sheets because dryer sheets are apparently bad for my body or something
400.04	1.4	And then I tried to get dryer balls
401.44	2.87	but then Daniel’s mom says dryer balls don’t really work
405.41	2.5	So like what am I supposed to do when my clothes are damp?
408.72	5.22	Like should I get one on those like clothes hangers to like dry my clothes off?
414.89	1.18	Like probably
416.75	2.81	But my room is so messy right now I really wanna clean it I really wanna go
420.19	2.05	I wanna go home and do my laundry and stuff like that
422.24	2.09	so that I don’t embarrass myself in front of Amy
425.46	5.85	But then I have a bunch of Cascade and stuff that’s in my bathroom and then from like board that’s like taking so much space
432.35	1.38	And I should probably give to Lauren
433.73	2.21	but like I feel bad asking her but
436.56	5.22	And how am I even gonna like carry it all the way to the social like it’s so heavy
443.46	1.58	I should get better at meal prepping
446.99	2.14	Tomorrow is a Friday
450.12	2.82	And I don’t get free lun- and I don’t get free lunch anymore
453.54	7.71	But that’s like a while from now so I should probably bring my rice or something to eat tomorrow because I’m going to be really really hungry
461.52	1.28	And I really need to cut down on boba
462.8	1.58	because boba has so much sugar in it
465.6	1.87	But I don’t think my diet’s even that bad
467.47	1.26	but why am I so weak?
469.5	1.86	Like why does my body have so many problems?
473.13	5.17	Like I really need to go see a chiropracticion pra- chiropractor when I go home
479.62	2.76	Like I’m going home in like a monthish
482.92	0.95	That’s crazy
485.35	6.48	I’m really excited for um my childhood friend to finally visit me in America
492.78	1.05	I feel bad because like
493.83	2.67	what if like when I like go see my friends
497.05	5.76	Like I already asked them but they’re not comfortable with him coming with me right because like they don’t really know him and stuff
503.51	5.48	So like when I’m out there like just hanging out with my friends he’s just gonna stay at our house and just like do nothing
509.72	3.11	Like I feel I feel really bad like I feel like should take him places
512.83	6.55	but I also can’t take him everywhere because I also have like things I wanna do and like friends I wanna meet
520.03	3.36	But then mom keeps saying that I have to bring him to everywhere but like I don’t
524.02	7.35	I feel like I can’t really bring him to everywhere like when I want to have like a one on one girl time with someone then like I have to bring him
532.48	1.12	That would be so awkward bu-
533.6	1.01	so I feel so bad
535.33	4.36	That’s why my that’s why mom wants to send me like send him to like the tour bus [inaudible]
540.14	3.12	But if you go on the tour bus then you’re going to be alone you’re not going to have any friends
543.26	2.37	so I feel like extra bad about that
546.26	1.67	And I really wanna take him to Disneyland
547.93	2.37	but like Disneyland tickets are so expensive now
550.83	2.75	One day I think it was like two hundred dollars
554.06	3.26	Two hundred dollars for one day at Disneyland is so not it
557.32	7.12	like I remember when the annual the annual tickets were like only like four hundred dollars
566.23	3.9	And like ugh it was so fun going with mom and Rachel like when I was young
571.31	1.97	Like now it’s two hundred dollars for one day like
573.28	1.2	I can’t really afford that
575.03	1.0	But I really wanna go
577.05	1.31	We should just go to six flags
578.36	1.95	but like six flags is so far from our house
580.31	4.17	like I don’t think I can drive an hour and thirty through LA to get there
585.25	2.77	Like I’m not even a like I’m not even like the best driver
588.74	7.35	I mean I guess I can drive but I’ve never like really driven in Baltimore or anywhere where drivers can be so aggressive
596.45	4.9	I swear I almost got hit like I almost get hit once a week because
