1.51	2.2	The spinning is really loud.
4.05	3.8	I hope I'm talking loud enough that the microphone can pick it up.
7.93	2.66	The microphone is like right against my nose.
11.47	5.02	This evening is very loud and repetitive and annoying, but it's okay.
16.59	1.68	I'm kind of tuning it out now.
19.09	10.36	And the cross is in front of me, and it's white, and it's got a little gray halo around it because I guess of psychology or whatever.
29.89	3.38	I wonder what I'm going to be eating for lunch and dinner today.
33.37	3.22	I should probably eat at home so I can save money
36.97	2.28	because my mom says that I've been spending too much money.
39.83	9.3	I'm going to be making a paycheck soon, which would be great because I need money on my own, and not be dependent upon my parents.
51.23	7.28	And I guess I'm a little bit worried about whether or not my head is moving around too much, because I feel like whenever I talk, my head does move around a little bit.
59.97	3.42	I'm trying to hold it steady, but is that just making it move more?
66.93	7.02	I guess this is the whole zen Buddhist principle of if you try to fix things, you're just going to muck them up and make them worse.
75.21	3.4	It's funny to think that someone is going to be listening to this later.
85.19	2.2	It's very interesting what's going on here.
87.95	3.92	This is my first MRI study and my first time being in an MRI.
92.11	10.2	It's very strange and it's kind of like what I thought it would be, but also very different and very interesting for sure.
103.39	5.72	I wonder if I'll ever be in an MRI again and if it'll be a similar experience.
109.17	6.12	I wonder whether this is a 7T or 3T or 1.5T MRI.
116.27	6.3	I guess it's a functional MRI, so I'm not really sure what the strength of functional MRI is.
123.39	7.63	I'm really looking forward to getting a picture of my brain, seeing if I have a brain tumor, lol, but I don't think that I have a brain tumor.
131.02	2.49	I have no symptoms of a brain tumor.
135.65	7.92	I kind of wonder what people are investigating, and I hope that I will be able to figure that out later.
143.57	8.56	I was going to ask for the name of the study so I can look it up later and see what the results were, because I think it would be really interesting to see what the results were.
153.43	6.06	It's a very interesting study design, and I really have no clue what they are investigating based on the study design.
159.55	8.22	I guess there could be a number of things, and maybe I really shouldn't be trying to figure that out, but it's interesting.
168.99	6.7	It's hard for me to keep my train of thought going because I do feel that sometimes my train of thought just goes blank and that's okay.
175.81	10.38	I try to be present in the moment and let my train of thought just, you know, so I can pay attention and be embedded in my environment.
186.75	7.16	I guess it's kind of nice sometimes just to let your train of thought go wild and for you to say whatever you want to say, just kind of therapeutic.
195.49	7.88	I hope you don't mind that I don't remember the researchers name from yesterday, because just in general I have a really hard time remembering names.
204.33	3.28	I feel insecure about that sometimes, people not.
208.45	7.56	I wonder if they get offended that I don't remember their names because it, yeah.
216.15	2.02	But I hope I'm doing the right activity.
218.39	1.56	I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right activity.
220.49	16.3	There's this cross written for me and it's reminding me of religion and Christianity and this experience I had recently with my parents, where we were in the ministry of brewing for medical school and I'm telling my parents about that.
238.39	5.18	My friend thought that it was really uncomfortable because the ministry of brewing is an old Catholic church.
244.29	7.85	And like I was telling my friends, it's just really uncomfortable for my parents who are deeply Catholic to be there.
253.12	3.15	And they were very weirded out, which I mean, be weirded out by proxy.
257.57	14.7	But sometimes I wish I could be more honest about how I'm not really religious, and really identify as an atheist and, well, you know, I'm Buddhist but in a more secular sense.
273.15	5.65	So, I really am worried that they wouldn't accept me.
279.31	7.24	And I've already had to come out to them as gay, so it would just be, I mean, picking it at a low moment.
286.79	6.68	I'm not sure I really want to do that right now, especially in this stage of my life where I'm more settled down.
294.39	5.08	I feel like they kind of know already, it's kind of like elephant in the room, so that's the point of telling them because I'm still at this point.
300.13	8.58	I mean, we've already kind of had discussions about it and those have been uncomfortable, so to tell them I feel like it would just be more uncomfortable discussions.
312.73	12.62	So, I'm thinking about, I have that study coming up where everyone's looking at whether or not I have sleep apnea, and I think it's like unlikely that I have sleep apnea overall.
325.63	2.29	I'm not really the right age demographic.
330.42	3.35	I'm pretty skinny, but skinny people have sleep apnea sometimes.
333.91	3.67	And my male body is really terrible, and I do wake up gasping.
338.21	1.5	So, I feel like I shouldn't let...
340.89	10.26	I feel like a lot of people in medical school have that worry of like denying the patient who has endless anxiety and is taking up too many medical resources.
352.11	3.87	But at the same time, I'm going to be going into residency, and it's going to be really stressful.
356.93	3.73	And I don't want to have to deal with hypognathic sleep apnea.
360.71	8.48	So, I feel like I should just be careful because even though the pre-draft probability is low, I want to be in my best mental state possible.
370.2	4.87	And I do wake up gasping for air, and I think that's not normal.
375.79	26.14	My dad has it really bad and his is like weird because, like I was telling my doctor, apparently his doctor, my dad's medical literacy is so low, he was saying his doctor thought it was like central etiology which is really weird because my dad does really have restrictive sleep apnea, kind of like picture going on, but I don't know.
402.21	1.26	So, I just want to get it checked out.
403.95	2.02	It's like I never want to sleep on my back.
406.25	7.36	I was thinking about this earlier this morning, I feel like my thoughts sometimes go in circles because I'm just trying to justify.
417.94	5.95	But I'm not moving around too much, I definitely feel like it's hard to keep my head still while I'm talking.
424.43	10.2	Every time I'm taking in a deeper breath, like getting started talking because I'm just kind of exacerbating to just keep on talking and talking and talking.
435.39	7.13	It makes me really glad that I don't have to like, I can talk inside my head, whatever that means.
443.7	3.03	I'm not really talking inside my head, that's not a little thing I'm not used to talking.
447.55	16.9	But if I had to speak out loud all the time, not only would that just like open up, not allow me to have my own private thoughts but also just be a lot of work, a lot of breathing, so it's much easier, you can like even talk faster inside your head than you can really talk out loud.
464.83	5.64	I'm such a self-conscious person, I wonder why the person listening to this is going to be laughing.
471.33	2.62	I'm kind of laughing at myself right now I guess.
475.33	1.56	But um, what is life, what is life?
476.95	1.56	I'm very existential.
483.43	0.81	And I'm going to cross that.
484.24	6.06	But the cross in front of me is so little, it's a fixation cross.
490.3	5.35	I'm not supposed to be fixing my wall, I guess I can fix on it if I want.
496.23	5.44	I'm probably mumbling right now, but I think that's okay because the people who are listening to this are all experts.
502.31	4.22	Are those cameras on the sides of the, on the circle?
507.23	3.42	I wonder if those are, am I being watched secretly?
510.65	1.08	Is the government watching me?
512.43	1.22	Am I developing schizophrenia?
515.91	1.68	Um, no, I'm not developing schizophrenia.
517.65	1.66	Austin, you're silly.
520.05	0.92	You're very silly.
524.19	3.44	Now I'm thinking about relationships
528.31	3.82	and I'm going to be moving to Dallas for starting residency soon.
533.49	2.58	And I really hope I meet someone there because
536.91	6.18	I feel like me and my longest relationship was only really like a few months, and I really liked him.
543.13	3.5	I would say I loved him, but I'm not sure if he loved me back.
548.01	2.82	So, I just really wish that I'm going to find someone.
550.89	1.98	I feel like my expectations are really high.
553.77	4.48	So, maybe I have to lower them.
559.23	4.12	But I feel like I get mixed kind of advice on that.
563.39	2.22	Some people say, oh, never lower your expectations.
565.71	6.46	And some people are like, they have to be realistic and relationships aren't found, are built.
572.57	12.82	And I kind of feel like I lean towards the latter on a rational level, but there's also this romantic part of me that really just like wants to fall in love with somebody, and I have done that before.
585.87	3.22	I feel like that has never really worked out for me up to this point.
590.81	6.24	So, maybe it is time that I grow up or whatever and just make a relationship that works.
597.65	2.36	But I also just really want someone who's cute.
