0.84	4.97	Um…oh, there was this pretty cool anime movie that I watched the other day.
8.29	1.37	Jujutsu Kaisen 0?
10.56	8.98	And, uh, I don’t think I ever actually watched um, like anime movie- well there was that one Belle, um, that was really cool.
19.58	5.04	Oh my gosh, the music was like, just like, completely something else.
29.45	7.18	0 is a really cool movie- I had never watched Jujutsu Kaisen before, so…and, uh, yeah, the movie was kind of my first exposure to it.
40.03	13.99	I mean, honestly, I feel like this is a- just another example of, I guess, how I’ve gotten more into mainstream anime uh these past few- at first since I really- uh- started high school or so…yeah.
55.95	5.19	Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, yeah.
61.27	11.14	And I mean- I guess it’s cooler like- “Oh, you only watch mainstream anime that’s like- you’re like a normie or something”, but…I mean, honestly, just, like, don’t gatekeep anime, ya know.
72.76	16.35	But…yeah, but like the movie was, like, it was really cool, um…like it’s kinda crazy looking back on it that the main character of the movie isn’t the main character of the anime, which is kinda crazy cuz like main characters have like this certain energy I guess.
94.42	9.3	It’s like really cool, like, the animation, oh my gosh it’s like, MAPPA never really misses, like with Attack on Titan, like, the latest season, it’s just, like, incredible.
104.55	7.47	And it’s- honestly has, only until relatively recently that I’ve kinda been following, like, specific animation studios.
112.56	5.66	Like Studio Wit, and, um, I guess it could be Spy X Family now, or Spy Family?
118.53	3.97	I have no idea, don't like pronouncing the X in anime, like Hunter X Hunter.
123.36	2.24	I mean, is it Hunter Hunter?
130.15	11.48	And, I mean, it’s kinda crazy how Spy X- Spy Family has kind of, like, I guess entered the mainstream anime world considering how Slice of Life it is basically.
142.15	7.48	I mean- I mean, granted, the main character’s a telepath but, you know, Slice of Li- anyway hahah.
159.05	10.86	I mean, yeah, it’s, like, pretty cool then I mean granted there aren’t like any super serious fight scenes considering it’s really more Slice of Life than anything.
170.52	7.47	Like as opposed to like Demon Slayer with like that one super cool fight scene between Tanjiro and that Lower Moon.
181.26	0.86	Rui, I think.
182.66	1.47	But yeah, it was really cool.
184.52	2.07	And the animation was just top-tier.
186.96	8.65	I mean, I guess- it’s like, I guess good animation’s like, really, I guess a really big part of storytelling, like, regardless of the medium.
196.14	2.4	And especially how it was paired with that music?
199.16	5.66	I mean, it was just top-tier storytelling, top-tier fight scene, all-around.
205.16	1.48	I can’t wait for the next season.
209.26	11.25	Um, I mean I got into watching- I mean, other than anime, like, “TV show” TV shows like the Kardashians show on Hulu.
221.08	18.55	I mean, I don’t really watch- I never watched Keeping Up with the Kardashians so like when I’m on Reddit, and the people are talking about how “Oh, um this new show is such a different vibe than Keeping Up with the Kardashians” and I’m like, well, I don’t know because I've never watched Keeping Up with the Kardashians, I’ve just seen like the new one on Hulu.
240.24	6.58	And I mean, it’s ok, like I’m surprised I’m watching it in the first place because I’ve never really been the reality TV show type.
247.47	8.55	Like, you know Real Housewives of Atlanta, like New York, Salt Lake City, Utah, whatever.
256.55	2.11	Um, never really been my thing.
259.54	4.67	Just kind of- the kind of thing I see on Daytime TV like with my mom or something.
264.92	17.79	But yeah, not really a thing I’d watch on my own, but you know, Kardashians, like I see them on media and stuff and there was that whole issue with Kanye and you know people think maybe he’s like crazy and all that and yeah…um, yeah.
282.74	1.58	I think it’s kind of interesting to see.
284.34	12.88	I mean it’s kind of- I mean, they still seem superficial, so it’s like- like Khloe has like all these- there’s this whole meme about her having these different faces all the time and it’s kinda like- “oh that’s weird” but yeah.
301.66	2.67	Yeah, it’s- it’s a good show though, I think.
305.03	3.19	I mean, I’m still following it, so I guess I haven’t gotten bored with it yet.
308.85	3.48	But, yeah, I’m glad I have Hulu, like in the first place.
312.35	12.27	Like, I got this student plan with Spotify and yeah it’s been really great so far, like honestly I’m surprised that I’ve gone this long without actually getting like a music service like Spotify.
324.86	7.35	Like I had Apple Music for three months cuz I got like a MacBook for college, iPad, whatever.
332.65	14.28	I got three months for Apple Music for free and that was really cool cuz honestly it’s so crazy like, like I mean I’ve used Youtube like you know, forever, and I actually looked at commercials.
347.3	4.34	And now it’s like three ads instead of one ad now and it’s like crazy.
351.88	21.44	So having like an- like, Apple Music, for example, like, there are no ads, no weird commercials in between the songs and it’s like I guess it’s uh pro of tech I never really noticed until I actually got the service and then the service ended and it was like $9.99 a month and I’m like, “I can’t pay $10 a month for like music”.
373.37	2.77	Like, yeah it’s convenient but $10?
376.54	0.76	I’m a college student.
377.92	17.01	But uh yeah so I had to switch to Spotify and they had their deal with Hulu so I got free Hulu too and yeah so I’m like really glad that I have that cuz Spotify’s like so convenient and Hulu has all these shows that I want.
394.96	2.28	Like, I was so surprised they had Spy Family the other day.
397.66	1.45	And I was like “Oh my gosh, they have Spy Family?”
399.46	1.61	But then I want to get too, ya know?
401.54	1.97	So, like that’s definitely nice.
403.55	2.16	They have Attack on Titans so I can continue that.
406.27	4.35	Oh, and it’s so crazy that they’re having a part 3 of their final season now.
411.14	3.99	Like, I thought it’d just be like, you know, season 4, done.
415.48	8.14	But no, it’s like season 4 part 1, a season 4 part 2, another season 4 part 3, and I don’t think I watched the last episode actually, so I need to do that.
424.08	7.73	Um, but yeah like season 4 part 3, but I’m looking forward to like whatever theme song they come up with, cuz…
432.22	18.14	Like, so far, it’s just been like really apt for each part of like season 4, like…they really work when they’re- when- with like, I guess the main theme of each season, so now they’re looking forward to see what they do with what will probably be the last season cuz you know, they’re really stretching it out.
450.43	6.89	Like I mean it was probably for the money, but like we don’t need like a Naruto: Shippuden like 2.0 you know?
457.77	11.24	So, yeah, um…like what else do I…but yeah, there’s like Attack on Titan, and there’s Demon Slayer- saw that on Hulu, too.
469.42	3.12	And I’m really glad about that, because- I mean, they could’ve launched it on Netflix.
472.57	5.14	But Netflix, oh my gosh, Netflix, it’s like they’re purposefully running themselves to the ground.
478.25	2.07	They’re like Blockbuster, it’s terrible.
480.68	11.73	Like, “Let’s crack down on subscribers, like oh, you have to…you can’t share one account anymore, you have to like go through all these verification things to make sure you’re not sharing a separate account with somebody.”
492.77	12.45	And it’s like all you’re doing is driving away, like, people who might have otherwise actually bought the service if you know you didn’t like alienate them for wanting to share others’ accounts, ya know?
505.89	2.02	And, yeah, it’s just crazy.
508.62	4.38	Um, but…and they have like this premium version that’s like $20.
513.06	1.68	It’s like, why?
514.77	16.24	Like, on Disney+ you can get like Disney, ESPN, and Hulu for like $16 and I’m like, I don’t know why Netflix is doing premium for like $20 a month and like that’s what you need to do to get rid of ads and have HD like TV?
531.45	4.06	It’s actually so crazy cuz in middle school it’s like, it was what like $6.99?
535.78	3.47	You can watch anything you wanted, high def, and it was good, you know?
539.71	5.67	But now, like, the Netflix account I’m on is like the cheapest version which is I guess still $6.99?
545.41	4.41	I think they upped the price to like $8.99 or something, but yeah.
549.91	9.7	But it’s crazy, and it’s like I don’t even use it anymore because it’s like, you don’t even what you’re watching is even nice anymore cuz it’s like 480 pixel…it’s terrible.
560.43	4.77	And, you know, Demon Slayer is on that, but like they only have the first season, and it’s not in high def.
565.48	7.43	And if you’re watching Demon Slayer, you have to watch it in high def, like…you’re, like, doing the animation a disservice if you’re not watching it on high def.
575.1	10.52	Like, so I can’t watch it on Netflix, I have to watch it on Hulu cuz like that’s the only place where it’s like- you know, like, clear and nice and…you know, it does the animation justice, you know?
587.15	1.87	So I don't really use Netflix anymore,
589.71	6.01	but, you know, I’m sure there are people who do and people who are willing to drop that kind of money but…not me.
596.09	3.1	I mean, like, it’s like on …what do you call it?
