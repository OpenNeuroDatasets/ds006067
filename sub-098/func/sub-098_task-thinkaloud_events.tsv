2.37	6.06	Oh, man, this like noise that it's right next to the right side of my head.
8.46	10.95	It almost sounds like if you gave noise to the massage guns that we have, it's just like [repetitive noise], that's the thing that is just like, you know, it's a thing.
20.94	4.13	Sensations I'm feeling in my body right now, a little tense.
25.94	2.82	I was worried about this beforehand just because in terms of like,
29.04	1.49	I'm a very fidgety person.
30.7	4.14	And you know what this is reminding me of the dentist's office, and I absolutely hate the dentist's office.
35.4	6.11	I'm also now realizing that as a person who talks a lot, I'm used to moving around a bunch.
41.91	3.75	So, I'm just saying these aloud so that hopefully I can get my body to relax
45.7	2.88	cause I'm definitely like talk with my hands, talk with everything else.
51.05	3.12	But I really hate the dentist's office, absolutely despise it.
54.57	4.75	I think it's probably because, one, I was so bad with my braces.
59.79	4.43	I got braces in sixth grade, Valentine's Day.
64.38	1.17	Yeah, it was absolutely awful.
65.6	0.77	Valentine's Day.
66.39	3.14	Who gives a kid braces on Valentine's Day?
69.89	4.73	Anyway, it made it really, really hard to eat for like the next couple of weeks.
74.64	3.71	And I don't remember if I got pink braces because it was Valentine's Day or not.
81.16	0.91	But I was really sad.
82.09	4.35	I remember being in math class and just couldn't eat the candy that all my friends were.
86.93	1.21	Anyway, I had braces.
88.17	3.98	I was told, oh, you know what, I'm only going to have these for like a year, year and a half.
92.47	4.46	And then we ended up moving, and then had to find a new orthodontist.
97.02	2.28	And then it was just like, okay, well, you know what?
99.35	1.98	You actually need braces for a lot longer.
101.69	1.32	It's like, are you kidding me?
103.37	3.15	So, I ended up having braces for like another year, year and a half longer.
107.05	12.21	And part of the reason why I couldn't like, well, sorry, I just need to... It's like weird to talk really quickly, but also have the constraints on.
119.88	1.76	It feels just like slightly constricting
121.69	1.56	because I'm definitely a fast talker.
123.27	2.8	So, I think I just need to take a deep breath.
128.4	3.91	But basically, they said, no, you need them on longer.
132.34	6.09	And then the rubber bands, I was so bad about my rubber bands, which are supposed to also, you know, like help fix your teeth.
138.45	1.51	And it was just like not working.
140.76	6.22	And I always got, that's the thing, dentists are just purely there to shame you and shame everything you do.
147.0	2.05	And they're like, oh, you don't brush your teeth enough.
149.09	1.09	Oh, you don't floss enough.
150.21	1.59	Oh, it's all bad.
151.84	1.81	And it's just like, come on, let me live my life.
157.99	1.32	Anyway, back to the dentist.
159.39	5.56	This very much feels like like an oral hygienist, just kind of like, I just get very tense at the dentist's office.
164.98	0.62	I don't know why.
165.64	0.63	I just do.
168.64	0.86	I think I looked it up once.
169.56	3.59	Like they're not cleaning your bones, but like kind of cleaning your bones.
173.18	1.28	So like that's the whole thing.
179.9	2.89	And I've been thinking about my teeth a lot recently because I was bad.
182.98	0.96	I was bad, guys.
183.96	3.71	I haven't been wearing my retainer and I had the braces on for so long.
188.25	0.65	You know what that means?
188.92	1.32	It means my teeth shifted.
190.89	4.38	And so, now I'm like, I don't want to get nudged by my mom and my parents.
195.43	1.43	Like you had braces.
196.98	1.12	What happened to your teeth?
198.13	1.74	So I'm trying to shift them back with the retainer.
199.88	2.04	And I think it is actually working a little bit.
202.43	6.95	So, kudos to the retainer and haha to the Internet that says your retainer actually can't shift back your teeth.
209.43	3.58	Because mine, I think it is or it could just be a placebo effect.
213.39	6.44	But it's finally getting to the point where it no longer hurts to put in, or hurts to take out too much, which is good.
220.24	5.15	Cause it always takes me like a good like 10 minutes just to, not 10 minutes, that's an exaggeration.
225.78	4.77	It always takes me a good minute or two to work up the courage to take it out in the morning or put it in at night.
230.62	0.93	That's getting easier.
231.64	0.69	That's nice.
234.12	3.09	So yes, thank you for listening to me lament about my teeth.
241.13	7.19	I mean, I think it just goes along with the whole like, you just don't want to be nudged by your parents and have to deal with all of that.
248.39	0.98	Cause that's annoying.
250.52	1.99	I'm on a quarter system for school,
252.74	3.09	so that means that the end of my quarter is coming up pretty soon.
255.85	2.06	So, I have a bunch of projects that I have to do.
259.74	13.65	I think it's a psychological phenomenon where you start to like lose when something's like the same color or something's really similar, like your eyesight kind of goes, or like it stops seeing it.
273.42	10.4	So, I've stopped seeing the like bars on the headset or head, not headrest, but head holder, I guess, head holder.
285.68	4.55	So, it's kind of going in and out of vision, which is fun and different.
295.1	6.83	Think I'm going to make- well, what's really exciting is that I'm going to use my rice cooker tonight to make rice.
301.94	0.72	I have beans.
302.84	1.52	I think I'm going to tacos,
304.78	0.99	but I didn't defrost the meat.
305.79	1.04	I always forget to.
307.2	0.64	It's always a thing.
309.14	1.69	But that's what you have a microwave for, right?
310.89	2.39	So, microwave is a gift from God.
313.64	1.37	I need to clean my room.
315.44	0.76	It's so bad.
316.23	4.71	I have a pile of clothes in the corner that's just like a mountain high.
321.34	1.33	So, hopefully I can get to that tonight.
322.7	1.21	Just put on a TV show.
324.28	2.53	You know, it's really annoying, I'm currently watching Outer Banks.
327.04	1.21	I didn't watch the second season.
329.84	0.67	I just couldn't.
331.02	0.77	I don't know why.
331.82	5.43	I watched the first full season, which was decent, and I just couldn't watch the second season.
337.32	3.5	So, I'm watching the third for who knows why, because I have nothing better to do.
343.66	5.43	I think, one, I cannot live in the Midwest because I just can't deal with Ohio as a state.
349.94	10.47	But also, I don't think I could live in the South because every single time that the father calls the son boy, it makes me want to like roll my eyes and hit something.
360.47	4.35	Because it's just like, oh, my God, can you just refer to him as anything other than boy?
365.24	4.07	It's also weird because he's obviously like a 20 year old playing 16 year old.
370.57	3.47	Yeah, it's just too much of it.
374.11	1.24	And also, like John B.
375.37	0.72	John B.
376.16	5.52	It's very similar to like in the Star Wars trilogies, in the prequels.
381.73	5.56	So, one through three, it's a very young Natalie Portman going, Annie, Annie, Annie.
387.33	1.09	It's really annoying.
389.37	1.05	My mom cannot stand it.
390.44	0.82	And I agree with her.
392.17	1.39	The prequels are not that great.
396.18	1.94	I can't remember the guy who plays Anakin.
400.58	0.79	He's good looking.
401.68	4.27	You know, once he gets to the like moody teenager, moody adult era.
409.02	0.6	It was crazy.
410.12	7.63	There are people in my life that I'm five years older than, I cannot believe that I interact with people who that I'm five years older than on a daily basis.
418.48	0.87	Do you know what that's like?
419.61	6.62	It's like if you interact with like a 15 year old, like that's so strange, it's just a strange sensation.
427.32	2.64	But anyway, I'm trying hard not to think about it too much.
432.63	0.71	I'm also trying to think.
433.37	2.73	What did I do with my... I got up fairly early.
436.12	1.54	I got up around like seven thirty or eight.
437.69	4.07	I'm trying to be better about my sleep schedule for NCAAs.
442.76	8.95	I personally believe that my body functions the best on seven to seven and a half hour, anywhere from seven to eight hours of sleep, like averaging around there.
451.73	6.03	I think that's the best, just because it still means I can still like nap during the day if I want.
457.87	0.84	You know what's crazy.
458.74	3.07	I think my body is perfectly adapted to the 26 minute nap.
462.43	8.92	Like it knows very quickly to fall asleep and then it'll actually like wake me up a little bit before the 26 minute mark goes off because it's just so in tune.
471.45	1.7	It's like, yep, you know exactly what we need.
473.17	2.69	And I've been doing it so often, especially in the library.
476.64	5.8	But my arms always like semi fall asleep in the library, which is kind of uncomfortable and sad.
482.99	16.4	Yeah, my arm, my wrists go to really weird angles when I'm like trying to fall asleep, which is worrisome because I'm always worried that they're going to like really badly fall asleep and I'm not going to be able to like fix them or whatever.
499.87	4.4	I don't think you can cause extreme nerve damage from it, but it can't be good.
504.33	3.0	Like your body doesn't like it for a reason.
510.48	17.33	But yeah, man, from my first experience in one of these, I wonder if I needed to get like another body part MRI, like would there be a different kind of like body holder or like would there still be the head holder, or what?
527.82	1.8	You know, because I don't know.
531.77	3.28	My knee has been giving me some trouble these past almost two months.
535.12	4.0	It'll be two months in like a week, which is really annoying.
542.52	1.15	Hopefully, I don't know if I need to.
544.17	8.4	Depending on whether or not it goes away, it'd probably be either an X-ray or an MRI to figure out what's going on, because it just doesn't make any sense as to why it's been bothering me this long.
554.79	4.89	Cause it stopped bothering me in like everyday life and even less in swimming.
559.71	14.37	But when we did, we did relay starts on Saturday and just like getting down and up like into the position of just holding it on the back of the block is like exactly what flares up, which is really frustrating because it was a good energy at the practice.
574.13	6.71	And it's that whole principle of like, okay, well, depending on how you leave it kind of determines how you look at the entire thing.
580.87	2.16	And that was the last thing that I was doing.
583.06	2.96	And I was just like, oh, no.
587.83	1.39	You know who's an incredible person?
589.44	0.36	Mav.
590.04	1.1	Mav is the best.
591.67	2.23	You can talk to Mav about literally anything.
594.12	2.68	I could probably go, Mav, I'm having horrible period cramps.
596.85	2.57	And he'd be like, Kaj, I am so sorry.
599.74	0.75	That's awful.
