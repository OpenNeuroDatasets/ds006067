This dataset is described in the following preprint: "Su, H., Li, X., Born, S., Honey, C.J., Chen, J., Lee, H., 2024. Neural dynamics of spontaneous memory recall and future thinking in the continuous flow of thoughts. biorXiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.02.616300"

A total of 118 participants completed a think-aloud task for 10 minutes while undergoing fMRI in a 3T Philips Ingenia Elition scanner. During the task, they verbally described any thoughts that came to mind, with their speech recorded using an MRI-compatible microphone. A gray screen with a white fixation cross was displayed, viewed through a mirror mounted on the head coil. 

Of the 118 participants, 43 were excluded from the fMRI analyses reported in the associated manuscript (Su et al., 2024) due to excessive motion (mean framewise displacement > 0.5 mm) or other factors listed below: 

Anatomical anomaly: sub-018, sub-097 
Artifact: sub-026 
Excessive motion: sub-009, sub-010, sub-012, sub-014, sub-017, sub-019, sub-023, sub-029, sub-032, sub-034, sub-038, sub-047, sub-048, sub-049, sub-052, sub-053, sub-055, sub-057, sub-058, sub-059, sub-068, sub-069, sub-071, sub-076, sub-077, sub-082, sub-083, sub-084, sub-085, sub-087, sub-089, sub-092, sub-093, sub-099, sub-110, sub-111, sub-116, sub-117, sub-120 
Projector disconnection during scan: sub-031 

Eight additional participants were scanned but were not included in the current dataset due to unusable behavioral responses, caused by truncated scans, poor audio recording quality, or failure to follow instructions.
