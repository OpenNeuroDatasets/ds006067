3.77	2.32	Okay, I didn't know this was going to be this long.
9.77	0.16	That's a good experience.
9.93	5.96	I had a friend of mine tell me she got into a panic state when she went into the machine.
16.55	1.1	But I think it's fine.
18.81	1.96	And the audio test was very weird.
21.39	4.34	And I think moving my jaws and not moving my head is...
28.19	3.28	Anyway, so I woke up in the morning and I was like, is it?
31.93	3.7	Should I be waking up in the morning for this thing?
36.43	0.66	But it was fine.
37.45	3.7	I woke up, I had a text from my friend who's back in India.
41.63	0.82	She called me.
43.19	1.56	She told me something crazy happened.
44.91	1.64	I don't know what crazy happened.
47.73	2.14	But yeah, she met an old friend of mine.
50.47	1.52	And then they talked about me.
52.61	1.82	I mean, she's fine, but I...
55.73	2.1	When I met her in the school, it was...
58.07	1.16	She was not that good.
59.87	2.6	I helped her win the election for the head girl.
63.63	1.62	She didn't give two shits about it.
66.09	0.66	And then she just...
67.21	4.06	I think she was the reason the group of my friends broke up.
71.99	1.24	It was 14 of us.
73.87	2.76	And then she and her pizza broke up.
78.15	1.46	I wonder what Karishma is doing.
80.67	4.02	I legit thought when she said something crazy happened, one of my friends got married.
86.35	1.14	But yeah, that didn't happen.
87.87	1.02	I miss Karishma though.
89.69	1.2	And I miss Rishika too.
91.67	3.92	Sometimes I feel if I hadn't talked to Karishma, Rishika would not have done what she did.
96.79	0.84	Am I moving ahead?
98.33	0.48	No, I'm not.
102.07	0.68	About friendship.
104.53	1.14	Why is my life so complicated?
106.71	3.18	It's just one thing that I want is to not feel about people.
111.01	1.78	But then, that's what happens.
113.71	0.18	Then Arushi...
115.31	1.26	What's wrong with Arushi?
117.13	0.46	I don't know.
118.69	2.06	She's two-timing on her boyfriend.
122.03	1.82	But the thing is I told her one thing about her.
124.99	3.5	And then she doesn't seem to care that she's cheating on him.
129.33	3.24	That is such a secret confession thing.
133.87	1.76	I hope this never gets out.
137.91	2.9	So, I also don't like Arushi.
142.01	3.76	I think she wants to make me feel bad about being myself.
146.67	1.78	The other night I was just kidding about it.
149.53	2.07	I mean, of course, I'm just kidding about it.
151.6	3.31	Why would she just take it in a different sense?
157.21	1.76	She takes everybody's...
161.01	4.44	She takes everyone's mouth at work as a joke except mine.
165.87	1.5	She thinks I'm always being serious.
169.83	5.58	It reminds me to share the Bob Ross reel again.
176.83	2.38	I'm happy that his movie is coming out.
180.19	1.86	That should introduce me to Bob Ross.
182.09	1.54	But yeah, that's awesome.
183.93	2.88	Yeah, he was so cute.
187.33	2.0	And he was so nice and he was so positive.
189.75	1.44	God, I love Bob Ross.
191.55	2.86	But then now the thing is everyone's going to know about Bob Ross.
195.47	0.04	Which...
195.73	0.7	I don't know.
197.13	0.98	It's kind of...
198.43	4.0	You know that song that you like and it suddenly gets famous.
202.59	1.72	And then you're like, oh, it's your song.
205.09	1.56	Yeah, Bob Ross is that thing.
207.87	2.02	I feel like my mind is a constant...
213.13	2.94	Jungle of reels and memes going on.
217.07	1.4	I can think about it.
219.13	2.24	Oh, shit, I should have asked if I could sing a song.
221.45	1.46	I could have sung a lot of songs.
227.77	1.0	But I think singing songs are not exactly a brain thing.
230.81	0.5	Brain thing.
232.03	2.88	So, I saw this series yesterday.
235.43	2.0	I kind of felt guilty about binge watching it.
237.47	1.28	But I did binge watch it.
239.37	1.14	It was fun.
241.51	3.5	It's so related to something that Beyoncé fans would do.
245.61	1.48	It totally killed for her.
251.65	1.5	I didn't realize it was a serial killer shit until it started to make sense.
253.79	1.64	And it was good, but I don't know.
256.11	1.22	It was kind of disgusting.
258.97	8.0	I mean, I don't mind the killing and all, but yeah, it was disgusting to just ask who's your favorite singer and if it's not Beyoncé, just kill it.
267.33	0.58	Kill them.
269.89	0.12	That was terrible.
271.89	2.08	At first I thought she even killed her foster sister, but she didn't.
274.03	1.36	Which is a good thing.
276.25	0.78	The foster sister.
277.43	3.46	I saw a series called The Foster Family.
281.11	1.14	I don't know what was it called.
282.89	3.24	That was my first time knowing about foster students.
286.77	0.6	Students?
288.37	0.04	No.
288.47	0.76	Foster children.
291.59	0.3	Students.
292.77	7.64	I think the shelter that I worked in, they were children too, but I don't know.
300.41	4.3	You'd think that somebody would want to study to see a way out of their struggle.
305.81	2.5	But yeah, they didn't care about studying at all.
310.03	1.48	I don't know why they don't care about studying.
312.21	3.6	Sometimes I feel if my parents were not that strict, I wouldn't be studying at all.
317.63	5.5	If I were given money, I mean, if I were given anything that I ever wanted, what would I do?
323.37	0.6	I would paint.
324.07	1.54	I would get naked and paint.
327.93	3.06	Whatever it is, whatever happens, happens for the good.
332.65	1.76	I wonder if I can drink water.
336.27	2.66	I mean, not made experiment, but yeah, whatever.
340.61	2.18	I think I've shaken my head a lot of times.
343.81	1.42	No, no, I haven't shaken my head.
346.85	0.92	Shaked my head.
348.55	1.86	When somebody mentioned SMH.
350.79	1.48	I'm like, what the fuck is SMH?
352.41	1.1	Am I allowed to swear?
354.13	0.54	I don't know.
355.11	1.22	I should have asked this.
358.89	3.7	I didn't think 10 minutes talking would be so tiring.
363.41	1.06	I don't talk that much.
365.53	4.36	So, when I went to D.C., I saw all of these videos.
370.85	1.76	I wondered if I'm being mean to them.
373.81	1.6	But I'm not being mean, right?
375.53	1.18	I'm just being funny.
377.19	2.14	What would they do without a funny friend?
380.93	1.1	Their lives would be boring.
383.21	2.58	But again, nobody knows that I'm not this funny.
386.61	2.78	In reality, I'm just not funny.
389.81	1.36	I just try to be funny.
394.49	5.4	This class is kind of a horror movie setting.
400.35	1.0	I don't know why.
402.53	0.52	Oh, my God.
403.07	2.32	I just remembered Final Destination.
406.69	2.66	So, there was this class, the eye surgery.
409.93	1.8	And then the machine just collapses.
413.11	2.58	At this point, you'd think I would panic, but I didn't.
416.15	2.86	I am not panicking, zero regard for my life.
419.67	0.68	Whatsoever.
421.05	0.82	I'm kidding.
423.79	1.86	I got an internship, should I go home?
426.85	0.72	I don't know.
427.99	0.94	Should I?
430.83	1.04	I think I should.
433.79	2.46	But I don't know, I can't stay at home for too long.
437.03	1.5	It's just very irritating.
438.87	2.18	I can't stand them for more than a week.
442.11	1.72	I'll probably go on a trip.
444.97	1.28	That's something else.
448.73	1.0	I think I'm audible.
451.47	1.34	But what do words have to do with this?
452.91	1.84	I think it's just the brain activity.
456.91	9.38	I once read, once saw this story on Discovery where a man fell and hurt his head and became too good at math.
467.03	6.56	I mean, I was too good at math, but what if I just hurt my head and became an ultimate legend at math?
477.69	3.0	I think they should've strapped my head to this thing.
482.29	2.74	That would be a mental asylum shift, I don't know.
489.13	1.12	I hate the sound.
491.25	2.44	It's just so irritating.
495.69	1.42	And I'm irritating.
498.15	1.2	Who else is irritating?
500.15	2.12	A lot of people are irritating, but not me.
503.33	4.74	Sometimes I feel like I'm being irritating, but then I'm like, no, I'm awesome.
509.61	3.5	Is it me, or just me pretending to stuff?
514.15	4.04	God, I don't like this profound inner thinking that I'm doing.
519.75	1.72	I do not want to end just like that.
521.47	1.46	That's the last thing I want to do.
523.77	1.36	But yeah, anyway.
525.99	1.56	Let me think about food.
528.65	0.94	Food.
531.23	5.82	I mean, I'm not bored of dosas, but I would love to eat sambar.
537.43	2.26	The sambar that I ate that day was horrible.
540.73	7.26	I just want genuine sambar from my mother's hands, which is awesome.
549.17	2.9	Also, I should've asked if I can think aloud in Hindi.
552.7	0.95	That would be awesome.
558.49	2.76	I've never thought what if we think.
562.19	1.7	What language do I think in?
564.65	1.74	It's usually English, no.
566.57	0.99	In English I speak.
568.15	1.66	Maybe I think in Hindi, I don't know.
571.19	3.22	But that doesn't go on in my mind that I'm constantly translating.
574.49	0.69	Nope.
575.68	1.01	I think I think in English.
580.07	1.34	I feel like Alan Watts.
583.07	0.66	Alan Watts.
585.89	1.0	That shit interests me.
587.37	3.42	I don't know why people consider Alan Watts with psychedelics.
592.33	0.4	But yeah.
593.45	1.2	That's good.
595.39	6.88	I feel like if enough people get into philosophy, we can change the world.
