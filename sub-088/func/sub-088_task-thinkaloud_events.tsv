9.37	5.44	I think it's kind of hard to think with the sounds, but maybe that's just how it is.
16.11	2.84	I think I'm kind of nauseous for...
20.72	4.33	Not for no reason, but probably from lack of sleep.
26.15	4.72	I think I always say that I should get more sleep, but then I don't do it, and then I feel shitty.
31.41	2.18	But maybe that's just how things are.
34.37	12.1	I think I'm in kind of a weird situation with a friend, and I'm not really sure what to do. And I don't know if I can clearly articulate that problem to other people to get advice.
46.55	3.36	So I'm kind of at a...
51.04	3.6	I don't think crossroads is the right word, but just like a...
54.79	1.78	I'm not really sure what to do.
59.75	6.37	I think the sound is kind of distracting, so I'm not really sure about other thoughts going through my head.
68.41	12.08	Yeah, there are some pink paint on the mirror. And yeah, it kind of sucks that I have really bad vision.
81.97	3.04	Imagine waking up and you open your eyes and you're able to see.
85.21	17.8	I guess that's what you could do if you had night contacts, which if you think about it, it's actually really cool that all you have to do is put on contacts, or put stuff on your eyes at night, and then you wake up and you're able to see.
104.04	1.84	That's pretty amazing.
109.21	6.22	I think I wish I had good vision, but it's like I don't do anything about it not to make my vision worse.
116.37	10.2	I think my vision had stabilized for like a year-ish, and then I think it got worse with COVID because of just too much phone and computer use.
127.19	2.08	And then now I just don't really...
130.21	5.2	I think I should be paying more attention, but then I don't really, so yeah, I don't know.
135.65	14.26	I think beyond a certain point, when your vision is way too bad, you can't get LASIK, so I guess I'm not trying to be like that. But I also know that even if you get LASIK, when you get older, it kind of doesn't work as well.
150.19	8.0	Anyway, I think that's what happened to my mom, and now it's like she needs separate glasses for seeing far and seeing close, which is kind of tough.
159.19	8.34	But yeah, I wish I had the good genetics to be able to see clearly when I just wake up and open my eyes.
167.57	8.7	I think it's a pretty... I don't know if it's like privilege, but it's just like, yeah, you're able to see, and I'm really impressed.
176.59	3.69	But I am also easily impressed, so there's that.
187.79	10.58	Sometimes if I think about it, it's really, really weird or strange, or absurd that how you ended up at this moment.
199.09	3.84	Sometimes I'm like, what the hell am I doing in Baltimore?
205.29	3.23	It's so, so weird how things turn out.
209.89	9.52	Yeah, I really don't know what the fuck I'm doing here, and I don't know how I ended up in fucking Baltimore.
220.42	2.45	I don't even think it's like a Baltimore issue.
223.05	2.18	It's not like a Baltimore issue, it's just like a...
228.45	11.62	I'm sure Baltimore is nice and there's stuff to do here, and it's just like, Hopkins students low-key gentrifying at least our area, but I just don't really go anywhere ever.
240.79	15.36	But I think the same problems would arise at another school, so it's not like it's really meaningful or worthwhile to really try to do something about it in terms of transferring.
256.59	9.17	And I think my activation, like my barrier to doing anything, is having to write application essays.
266.3	8.12	So that's low-key my downfall because I don't want to write essays asking me about why I want to do this.
275.19	7.44	And I don't know how to explain myself, so that is my, I would say, biggest barrier to actually getting shit done because I just don't want to explain myself and verbalize.
289.57	8.88	And, I don't know, explain why you deserve to do this or why you really want to do that.
298.65	10.18	I don't know, it's just like, sometimes I think I should and that's probably not a good reason, but yeah, so I think that would be my biggest barrier.
309.11	15.56	I don't think it's worth putting in the trouble to apply to transfer somewhere else, because, well, yeah, I mean part of it is like I really, really don't like writing applications, and part of it is like, it could be worse.
324.85	11.26	So it's like an uncertain, not even, I don't know if reward, but just like, you don't know even if you go somewhere else, like you're just running away from your problems.
336.19	15.62	I don't think it really would do anything, but I guess that's like part of, you never know, you never know how things could have turned out if a small thing was different.
352.49	22.7	I don't know if it's like the butterfly effect. I don't think it's the butterfly effect because that would be like, I guess, or maybe if it's just like a very small change somewhere,. Avery small change somewhere can have a large difference later down the road or somewhere spatially far.
377.11	6.37	Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what the term would be, but it's like the two roads diverge type of thing.
383.48	9.09	You never really know what could have been, and I think that's just how it is.
398.27	13.48	Yeah. And I think like someone said that that's kind of part of growing up, that like you have to make these choices and you have to close these doors and you can't like do, realistically you can't do everything, right?
411.85	19.4	So, it's like you have to make these decisions that close the doors on certain paths or opportunities because you cannot do it all. And it's like when you're young and you have a lot of possibility, but you have to make decisions that kind of set you on one path or the other.
431.85	2.66	Although I don't think it's necessarily the end all be all.
435.11	18.34	I think that there's always time, there's always opportunity to change or get out of it. But obviously, that would be a bit of a circuitous route and less direct. But I don't know, maybe you enjoy the scenic way.
458.7	6.39	I think it's just you just have to make those decisions and really think about what you want.
465.58	4.63	But I also don't know, it's like I feel like I don't trust myself not to make bad decisions.
470.94	9.28	But you kind of have to, or I guess I kind of have to think about what I actually want and what I actually want to do.
480.91	2.22	And yeah, I really don't know.
484.0	9.71	I really don't know, and that's why I think my response is always like, I don't know because I don't want to commit to making a decision in a way.
495.55	1.46	Yeah, I don't know.
497.28	11.7	It's like you never really know if it's the right decision to make until later on when you see the impacts of that.
509.8	2.49	And yeah, I don't know.
512.79	0.48	I think I'm just afraid.
513.7	2.31	I think I'm afraid of committing to something and it being wrong.
517.23	1.14	But then you can't really.
520.5	3.99	But if you're paralyzed by indecision, then you don't really get anywhere.
526.08	4.45	And like, you sometimes have to take risks to get shit done.
531.07	2.99	But I kind of don't want to.
535.16	8.74	I don't know. Not that, but it's just like, I don't really want to commit to something because I'm afraid that it would be wrong.
544.35	2.04	But at the same time, you can't really.
548.62	1.32	At the same time, you have to do it.
550.7	34.61	Like even if you don't know what you're doing or what you want to do, sometimes you just have to convince yourself that you know what's up, and to pick something and just stick with it rather than just like shitting bricks because you don't really know. Or not that you don't really know, but it's just like, rather than spending the time and energy into bemoaning, or like spending that energy into that indecision and evaluating your options, which is good.
585.67	5.52	But I think like at some point you just need to like pick something and just do it.
591.77	11.06	Yeah. The beeping sounds are kind of loud and I don't know, it's like, I don't know if it's like distracting.
