1.98	1.56	Cool, I see the beginning now.
5.94	7.46	I do wish Sienna did a little bit better job of explaining what the different symbols mean, but I understand that she probably had a very rough day.
14.5	7.74	Her previous research patient, or whatever the volunteer you'd call that, canceled on her just a couple of hours ago.
23.88	3.12	No hard feelings there, she's doing her best.
27.56	7.46	She did a pretty good job of explaining how to go through this, what the instructions were.
35.04	3.6	I'm trying to remember, so I think the dot means play the word game.
39.0	2.16	I'll get to that bridge later.
42.34	1.3	I forgot how the saying goes.
44.9	2.26	I'm a little bit nervous about moving my head too much.
47.16	3.22	How much do I talk?
50.38	3.6	I mean, fuck, how much do I move when I talk or breathe?
55.66	1.22	Hopefully, not too much.
58.44	5.46	I was not expecting to be in an MRI today, but you take it as it comes.
65.2	8.4	I'm missing my micro lecture for this, which shouldn't be a problem since I only missed one ever lecture this past semester so far.
74.66	7.26	My only concern is that we have a quiz on Wednesday, but I'm getting one of my buddies to send me the notes that he's going to take.
82.66	1.9	I wonder what time it is right now.
84.68	4.34	The lecture starts at 3, so he'll be sending me notes on what the quiz is going to look like.
89.66	2.5	I haven't really studied that much for it so far.
92.18	3.03	I did some studying for the homework assignments this past weekend.
95.21	10.89	I felt super solid on everything tested on the assignments, but my macro quiz went pretty trash, so I'm not trying to have a repeat of that.
110.08	3.74	Maybe I should have studied more this weekend, but give myself a break.
114.72	6.34	It was on Saturday that I found out that my good friend Paige passed away.
121.1	1.94	Sort of fucked up.
123.24	11.08	That really threw my entire weekend for a loop because I couldn't sleep very well Saturday evening, and then Sunday I slept in a bit and showed up 10-15 minutes late to my tutoring session.
138.9	15.28	It's so weird to hear because I haven't seen anything from social media, or any of our mutual friends about Paige having passed, but I did see two people post, rest in peace, with the same image of them on New Year's three years ago.
157.46	9.08	I'm very curious how it is that they went because I remember back when we were closer they talked about buying a gun, potentially shoot themselves.
166.7	1.92	They're also ketamine addicts.
169.78	2.39	Really, I guess one or the other.
172.35	0.71	It doesn't have to be.
173.4	2.62	I guess they could have gotten hit by a car.
176.66	2.22	That happens quite often.
179.78	2.68	A process of elimination here.
182.66	2.74	They're definitely suffering from some mental affliction.
186.34	2.22	Their partner already deleted their Instagram.
188.72	2.32	I wonder if that has anything to do with it.
192.16	5.2	Regardless, definitely need to pour some more champagne for their name there.
199.32	3.44	Somewhere significant would be fantastic, but I'm out of Baltimore.
202.78	7.74	It's not like I can just catch a train back to Boston to say hi to a bunch of people I haven't talked to in a year and a half.
211.28	5.92	Hopefully, I'll get the chance sometime in the future to properly pay my respects.
217.82	4.84	It's quite unfortunate because also Jay had passed a year and a half ago.
223.48	1.58	From that same friend group.
226.26	4.1	Really hoping that people who still hung out with that group are doing all right.
231.7	7.84	Maybe I'm just making excuses for myself for staying out and indulging when I should have just focused on studying.
240.76	1.38	Not that I wasn't doing that.
242.33	0.68	I definitely studied.
243.1	1.38	I got all my assignments in.
244.5	2.86	I was reviewing topics for both micro and macro.
248.02	1.26	I had another career in calculus.
251.16	2.87	We got our quiz next week on derivatives.
254.85	1.49	I did that when I was 16.
256.62	0.94	Nothing to worry about there.
260.64	5.28	So much time went into this whole Gustavo Frenk...
266.04	6.3	Gustavo Frenk rehearsal for the gig we have on Friday.
273.94	2.05	Hopefully, we get to change our name.
276.08	2.53	I don't even know if Sloshlite is a good name.
278.61	1.96	Gustavo Frenk is not going to stick.
280.75	1.09	There's no way we're going to keep that.
281.84	5.64	That was just on a whim because WJHU was asking for a name, and that's all I could think of.
288.02	4.72	So, fuck WJHU for not knowing how to organize a concert.
293.42	8.78	I'll hopefully do it better by the time I get into acquisition of a living space or basement, or hopefully a house.
302.58	7.1	I'd expect north of Homewood where I can host my own shows and plan events.
310.58	3.72	Throw some parties, do some cover charge to help pay the rent.
314.39	1.07	Something low, 5 bucks.
316.58	2.64	Something Baltimore doesn't really get to see that often.
319.26	10.96	It's crazy, you'd expect in a city like Baltimore where housing prices are so low and there's so many vacant properties that you'd actually see a DIY scene which shows that costs like 5 bucks.
330.22	7.11	But no, everything's at fucking like Autobar and The Crown or Mondo.
337.33	8.47	And everything's like 20 bucks, 25 bucks to see a show where there's maybe 2 dozen people that show up I mean, there's some shitty post-punk band.
346.5	2.36	No Wave, I mean No Wave is sick.
349.54	1.42	Half Japanese is cool.
351.46	3.58	Michael in that band is the homie.
355.04	4.08	But, yeah, just not really my thing.
361.7	3.44	It's too bad I haven't gotten to go to DC to see what the scene out there is like.
367.02	2.64	I mean, Commander Salamander, rest in peace.
370.8	4.81	Origami Angel, I don't even know what other emo bands are from out there.
375.61	5.17	I don't know shit about the DC scene, but Origami Angel is enough to tell me DC has it going on.
381.8	4.62	I'm glad I made it to Philly so far since I've been out here in the mid-Atlantic since.
389.02	2.94	I mean, I didn't really go to any shows, but I got to know the city.
392.16	1.78	I met the people at Mechanical Canine.
394.74	2.2	I just found out that Jink is from Philly.
397.68	2.59	Cool, I guess, but fuck those guys.
400.27	1.05	Bunch of creeps.
402.14	6.16	So glad that they're lead singer has been shut off from the music community.
409.16	6.0	Does not need that as a platform to fulfill his grooming, strange grooming fetish.
417.22	7.72	It'd be cool if I could start my own band and get something going off, but I'm not sure if Gustavo Frenk is really going anywhere.
427.4	2.38	Hopefully it will.
429.87	4.75	Thomas needs to get his head out of this fucking dissonant realm.
436.36	2.9	I'm not sure if Matt Warren was the best pick to play bass.
440.82	2.2	We'll see if he holds his own or not.
443.2	1.02	He has good music taste.
450.2	5.22	He's not even as good as I was when I first started playing at Superhead two years ago.
458.91	4.47	We'll have him on sound and hopefully we'll get him on this synth idea.
463.4	2.54	That'd be so fucking cool if he could start playing synth.
466.58	3.29	But he needs to reach into his comfort zone there.
470.15	0.85	I'm saying into it, not out of it.
471.4	1.97	He says he's more of a bassist, but he's really not.
474.01	1.07	I know he's got the keyboard skills.
475.12	0.55	It's simpler.
475.72	2.96	He does the audio engineering to make some really sick sounds.
479.9	10.44	I think we could do something that's both unique and also fits into the current emo 5th wave right now.
491.56	1.97	Get something of a scene going out in Baltimore.
493.71	1.17	Hopefully with Johns Hopkins students.
494.96	4.66	Because people do not do enough with their lives at Johns Hopkins.
499.96	2.62	They just sort of go to school, go to work.
502.96	4.3	Sure, they'll go out to dinner with some friends every once in a while.
507.68	2.62	If that's enough of a social life for you, yeah, that's fine.
510.98	3.96	But what about contributing something meaningful to a community, to a subculture?
516.5	4.58	Just some sort of development contribution to society that's more than the field of academics.
522.3	2.22	That's cool if you live for work.
524.7	4.52	I definitely get motivated by the work that I do.
530.16	3.2	It's not a ton, but it's a lot sometimes.
533.4	6.72	Working part-time, doing dual degree, that's certainly not enough to keep me going.
540.58	4.06	That's why I'm even starting bands in the first place, trying to go out and skate as much as I can.
546.06	3.66	What's the point if it's all work and no play?
551.06	3.88	You got to have a good mixture of both to balance itself out.
555.62	6.18	Ideally, I could make this whole band thing happen as a career, at least a side career.
562.62	2.68	It doesn't need to be a main thing.
565.57	2.23	I don't need to be going on tours all the time and have hundreds of thousands of listeners.
568.62	7.1	Just a couple of thousand, enough to support Northeastern tours every year or so.
576.62	9.58	So, I could expand my repertoire of cities.
586.2	0.67	Of course, got to go to the Sunbelt cities.
586.98	3.84	I want to check out Pittsburgh and get out to the Midwest and Ohio.
592.2	2.77	Chicago would be fantastic.
595.15	3.75	I need to go to Minnesota, see Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth.
