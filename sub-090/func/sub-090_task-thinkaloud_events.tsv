1.86	2.6	I feel very strange being in this box.
5.9	1.77	But the beeping is super loud.
9.6	0.52	But it's fine.
12.3	5.01	I feel like it's kind of calming to just stay here and do nothing for a bit.
20.49	5.75	After I go home, I have to figure out where I'm going to be for tonight's Twilight party.
27.53	5.73	But Twilight has no Indian characters, so I'm very much on the circle bus.
34.59	3.91	I think I'll just end up being Bella and wearing a plaid.
44.23	3.41	And then I don't know if they'll have food there, so I don't know if I have to eat before.
49.12	3.86	But I'm probably going to be late, but Simon will want to go on time.
54.77	2.78	So, maybe we'll go separately, I don't know.
58.14	5.57	Unless he decides to feed me, which would be nice, but I don't know what he'll make.
64.88	2.96	I don't really just want roasted vegetables for dinner.
69.86	7.63	I think if I'm eating at home, I'll probably make turkey hot dogs again, or pasta.
77.51	7.57	I've been really running out of food in this quest to not go grocery shopping,
85.2	2.07	but I feel like I should go buy vegetables.
87.33	2.36	But also, if I buy vegetables, I have to cook them.
91.44	4.26	And I feel like they always go bad.
97.22	5.15	Cause I don't know how to make meals centered around all vegetables together.
102.49	2.85	But I always buy too much when I go grocery shopping anyway.
106.13	3.28	I wanted to go to the farmer's market this morning, but I was really busy.
111.95	1.04	I wish I'd gone though.
117.33	3.2	Maybe tomorrow I'll go to Harris Teeter.
122.31	2.51	But I really don't want to go grocery shopping on Sunday.
124.85	2.31	It's so busy at Harris Teeter on Sunday.
129.33	2.02	Tomorrow's going to be so busy already.
132.94	6.6	I don't know if I'll be hungover in the morning, but if I'm not, I guess I'll have some time to work on things.
140.13	3.22	But I don't even know how much schoolwork I have to do because I haven't looked.
144.31	3.45	But I'd rather read my book, and I'm glad I finally have time to read my book.
149.92	6.93	So, tomorrow morning, if I'm not hungover, I'll make a list of everything I have to do for school.
157.42	1.23	Then I have to grade.
159.63	4.82	And then Jessica keeps asking me to do some report thing, but she never sends me the report.
164.52	2.03	So, I don't know when she wants me to do it by.
167.39	2.17	But their final thing is due on Wednesday.
170.83	4.32	So, she'll probably send it to me Tuesday and be like, do this, and I don't have...
176.46	1.81	Oh, she sends things so last minute.
180.16	1.62	Okay, back to Sunday.
182.41	0.66	Do work.
184.81	4.73	Oh, I was going to go volunteer in the morning, TBD on that.
189.57	1.39	I haven't been in so long.
192.51	3.24	And I really want to go, but it's so hard to make time to go.
197.82	4.95	I think I'll try my best to go, but I won't be able to do both because Layla has her thing at noon.
204.54	1.81	I wonder who will be at Layla's thing.
206.71	2.45	I think I only know Lori is going and Rachel.
209.45	0.9	I guess it'll be fun,
210.49	2.3	but I don't know Layla's any other friends.
213.82	0.71	So that'll be weird
214.63	1.57	because I'm not good at talking to people.
218.47	2.98	Maybe Anisha will be there from New York, but that'd be weird too.
222.39	0.61	But I liked her.
223.02	0.94	She's very cool.
226.33	1.96	I wonder how long Layla's thing will go.
228.34	2.06	I want to go to yoga in the afternoon.
231.18	6.09	I don't know if anyone's teaching at Brewer's, but Rotunda and Fathill are the same distance.
240.09	1.8	But they feel so much farther.
242.41	1.78	I don't know what I'll do tomorrow afternoon.
244.27	2.0	Hopefully Layla's thing is over by 2.
248.57	0.83	Layla's so sweet.
250.21	1.36	I wish we were better friends.
257.4	2.16	I don't know how to be better friends with someone though.
261.53	2.2	Feel like she's similarly quiet like me.
264.43	2.49	And therefore that itself is a barrier.
267.03	4.56	I feel like people that talk a lot are easier for me to be friends with.
275.61	3.03	Sunday, Monday...three weeks of school left.
278.71	1.24	That's so exciting.
281.14	1.62	This week seems super chill.
284.13	2.02	I have no idea what I'm going to do next weekend.
287.62	0.57	That's fine.
288.2	4.99	I'd like a weekend to do nothing, but I feel like I have things I need to do or have committed to.
294.63	1.48	And I don't remember what they are.
301.38	2.29	I feel like someone was doing something.
304.51	1.32	Maybe I'll have a free weekend.
305.89	1.38	That would be really nice.
308.77	1.89	I'm thinking about the pizza from last night.
312.02	1.23	It was just okay.
313.55	2.32	It did not exceed my expectations.
316.72	3.73	Maybe it didn't even meet my expectations, but it was good.
320.6	0.96	I would like some now.
323.49	1.28	Glad Simon paid for it.
326.37	1.49	That salad was gross though.
328.21	5.28	It had balsamic something and it tasted so terrible.
335.09	3.27	It's so strange that people like the flavor of balsamic to me.
339.13	0.97	It tastes like vomit.
342.47	7.99	I've now gotten to the point where I can appreciate a good salad, but never balsamic things.
352.53	1.15	I kind of want Shake Shack.
355.37	1.48	No time to drive to Shake Shack.
358.33	2.94	I want fries and a shroom sandwich.
363.12	0.88	It's been so long.
365.04	2.36	I don't know why I always have cravings for cheese.
368.33	2.26	Maybe I'll just make myself a quesadilla for dinner.
373.5	3.21	There's so much in my freezer that I need to work through as well.
377.13	3.93	I think I'll shift to freezer meals this week to get rid of a lot of stuff.
382.11	3.83	Oh, my gosh, I have tomato chutney still in my fridge that I haven't thrown out.
387.63	2.32	That's going to smell so bad when I open it.
391.33	2.89	I think I'll prolong throwing it out for even longer now.
395.71	4.44	My mom said it stays good for a few weeks, but it's been way more than a few weeks.
401.73	2.26	I remember Isa went to the farmer's market with me.
404.01	2.31	I feel so bad that I haven't hung out with her.
407.09	1.26	I can still see her tonight.
409.59	0.92	She's so sweet.
411.32	1.65	We're stepping up when he's gone.
415.8	0.54	I miss her.
416.44	0.98	I wonder when I'll see her.
418.33	2.16	Maybe this week with my free schedule.
422.02	1.67	If it's actually a free schedule.
425.1	3.37	I guess Monday night is busy because I'm going to the Silly Box.
429.72	1.58	I need to craft with Lori.
431.34	1.47	I haven't done that in forever.
433.81	1.25	She does the craft stuff
435.15	2.3	and I kind of want to keep it back at my house.
438.3	1.97	I'll ask her to come over instead.
441.63	1.57	I feel like Lori's not doing okay.
443.78	3.38	Oh, I won't even see her today.
447.2	1.15	She's going to Trivia.
449.12	0.92	I'll see her tomorrow.
450.45	1.39	I'll say, are you doing okay?
453.11	1.96	She'll say yes, like always.
457.19	2.1	I feel like Lori needs to go to therapy.
461.11	6.36	And she mentioned it herself, but I don't think she'll ever actually go.
467.65	1.02	But I hope she's okay.
470.9	1.53	I miss hanging out with her all the time.
472.62	0.74	It was really fun.
475.96	2.28	Katie, far, far away.
479.81	5.06	I feel like Katie's thriving though but Katie doesn't need us ever.
486.81	0.95	I'll go visit her.
489.53	1.42	I don't know when I'd go visit her.
490.97	3.77	I feel like I'd have to go end of April.
495.43	4.77	My mom might come, so I'll go before or after my mom comes.
500.22	1.74	But I also have to keep TAing.
503.83	2.52	So, I can't be gone for weeks at a time.
507.19	1.38	I need to check when I get back.
510.82	5.17	If I am missing two Tuesdays in a row, that would be bad.
517.19	1.76	I guess I could do one of them online.
520.01	1.84	I don't know how much the time difference is.
521.88	3.27	I feel like I'd be TAing from Spain on Tuesday night.
526.3	0.67	Maybe I won't.
529.46	2.02	Oh, the undergrads are so silly.
534.01	3.07	I can't believe some of them already are not submitting labs.
537.7	2.69	Not one of them is Bella's child.
542.23	3.59	I feel bad that I want her to like me because she's related to Bella.
545.91	5.73	But she literally didn't turn in assignment 1 in at all.
553.61	2.25	And then didn't submit a lab either.
557.48	2.98	I feel bad for these kids, but they're not doing too hot.
562.22	1.23	I don't understand why though.
563.48	2.68	I feel like when I took the class it was so simple.
566.8	1.97	But it also changed from then.
569.91	3.71	Also, if everything is pass, fail, how can you not just pass it?
577.25	1.55	I literally don't understand.
580.94	2.04	Oh, my god, I bet she's going to be there tonight.
584.57	2.04	Oh, that's going to be so weird.
588.88	1.82	I want to bring my crochet stuff though.
590.94	1.83	And ask Danny for more advice.
593.31	3.87	But Danny is going to be like, you haven't worked on this at all since Sunday and I was like yeah...
598.6	0.87	Maybe I won't bring it.
599.5	1.47	That would detract from Twilight.
