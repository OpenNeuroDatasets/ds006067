onset	duration	transcript
2.38	2.96	I have clinicals tomorrow.
6.23	5.43	At least it starts at 11 instead of 6:30, 6:45.
12.56	1.42	So, I'm pretty happy about that.
16.96	5.26	Be 11 to 4, so we'll get on the floor.
24.2	5.17	Probably it'll be lunchtime for the patient, so I'll pass out lunch.
29.41	3.5	I think two students will get chosen to get off meds.
34.72	12.68	So yeah, meet a nurse, meet the patient, see if lunch needs to be served, any bed changes, linen changes, if anyone needs a bath.
50.82	2.61	Orders are actually at 11 o'clock.
54.67	2.76	I don't think lunch will be given out by then.
57.88	4.02	I would first want to make sure that everyone has their lunches ordered.
62.0	3.25	So, make sure lunches are ordered.
66.21	3.04	And then we'll probably still be on the floor to give out lunch.
70.61	4.41	I think around 2 is the biohazard unit tour.
75.25	0.98	Should be cool.
76.28	3.07	I wonder what that will kind of include.
79.42	4.0	If we're just walking, we get to sit and talk to people.
84.14	1.59	But I'm excited.
85.9	1.1	Should be something new.
89.76	2.52	Today's Wednesday.
92.91	3.14	So, one more week until chronic exam.
97.05	3.06	Less than a week until pharm exam.
102.11	1.28	It's pretty cold in here.
106.08	4.09	But maybe I'm cold, but I won't need to fall asleep.
117.34	3.21	Kind of catching up on the last module.
121.67	1.93	Last little thing.
123.72	2.43	I just got under the diabetes drugs.
126.71	2.67	So I did insulin, which is an injectable.
129.95	3.57	I did all the injectables that aren't insulin.
134.9	10.98	My mnemonics for that are Ingrid, Vibes, Excellent.
147.02	6.92	And then Amy, Lynn, Memes and Prom.
154.11	20.42	So Incretin might be my medic, [inaudible] my medic, but I have to know all of the oral diabetes drugs.
176.09	1.49	There's like 10 of them.
178.78	3.09	And then they are all going to treat diabetes.
187.4	1.35	Spanish night.
192.29	1.44	I have to eat dinner too.
193.91	2.86	I don't know if I'll get to study as much as I want.
198.72	3.09	I should look at diabetes tonight.
201.88	2.53	Or look at chronic.
206.09	3.63	I think I will look at diabetes tonight.
210.35	1.9	I think it will make me feel more secure.
214.37	3.18	Okay, so diabetes tonight.
218.25	2.64	As much as I can, even though I got Spanish at dinner.
222.7	3.77	Tomorrow morning, I really want to check my clinical.
229.19	2.62	Clinical, so I'm going to check for sure.
235.84	1.33	I'm getting pretty cold.
237.39	1.65	What's after this?
239.92	3.29	I think I'll go up and I know she'll talk to me.
244.16	2.78	It's the word chain game.
248.09	4.34	And I have to remember the grey circles.
253.53	2.29	It's a signal for the word chain game.
256.77	1.61	Grey circle, grey circle.
261.47	1.39	That's for two minutes.
266.92	1.74	I wonder what it looks like up there.
268.68	3.35	And in the operator room.
273.51	1.17	Or if they can hear me.
275.06	2.41	And she told me that they can't hear me.
282.53	6.62	I didn't realize that I'd be talking during the MRI scan.
289.19	0.96	I guess I should have known that.
290.66	0.52	But I forgot.
292.15	2.67	But it also makes sense at the same time.
297.08	1.41	I wonder if I'll just get used to it.
301.65	2.7	Okay, today's Wednesday, clinical tomorrow.
305.96	1.32	Appointment after.
313.21	3.26	Robin leaves on Monday night.
317.2	1.32	To go to Seattle.
319.21	1.11	Comes back Friday.
321.61	1.42	He'll come back Friday night though.
323.72	6.21	So I will have a Monday night, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
330.13	2.01	Pretty much all of Friday by myself.
333.36	3.11	But after Wednesday I should be chilling.
337.15	1.85	After my exams.
340.02	5.07	And tomorrow, which Friday, I should look at my life expectancy.
345.38	3.96	There's a lot to do, but hopefully not.
349.49	2.52	Because I have two exams.
354.49	1.09	Still pretty cold.
363.9	2.24	I hope my cats are feeling better.
367.38	5.17	Never had two cats that were sick, but their sneezes sound so cute.
375.87	4.44	I wonder if Robin gave Panko the drops this morning.
381.41	1.7	I know I gave Moshe a...
383.89	3.61	I think Moshe's feeling more sick than Panko.
388.38	1.87	So I'll have to be careful.
390.82	1.5	Panko's ear infection.
392.37	3.5	I've got to keep getting her those steroids in the morning.
398.01	8.26	And I should check on the last day is actually, so I need to look at my calendar.
407.83	2.57	Because I think there's a lot of tablets in there still.
411.01	4.24	But yeah, so I'll keep giving her ear infection steroids.
420.93	6.89	This weekend I'm going to study, gym, start my [withdrawal release].
431.28	1.25	Just get ready.
434.71	5.11	I wonder if I'm going to feel sad next week being up by myself in the apartment.
440.73	2.17	But hopefully not.
443.51	1.27	I wonder what I'm going to eat.
444.91	1.13	I should cook.
446.99	2.33	I'm going to cook next week.
451.11	2.55	Depends what Robin will eat the next couple days.
453.85	4.12	But some easter nuts or mac.
462.47	2.9	He makes vodka pasta better than I probably can.
466.31	0.94	Mac.
468.07	1.66	I can make pancakes.
470.59	1.98	I can make cornbread.
473.62	1.85	What about meals?
476.86	1.91	Some Spanish rice.
481.35	2.97	I could get a rotisserie chicken and some salsa.
485.78	2.38	Guac, cilantro.
492.78	2.8	I wonder if it matters if I move my legs or not.
496.93	1.72	As long as I'm not moving my head but...
505.97	5.16	So, I'll be able to eat on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
511.47	1.32	And a little bit of Friday.
513.53	5.54	I can switch to coffee shops and have them for a real food thing next week.
519.73	1.44	So, I don't want too long.
521.4	3.93	I'm going to be in the apartment, so I don't have a dirty space.
527.19	0.9	Could I do laundry?
528.16	4.89	Oh, gosh, I have to put all the laundry on the floor.
534.17	2.2	I need to wash more clothes.
537.82	2.71	Got to have room for the kids.
540.94	3.03	I'm not going to do anything else because my clothes are on the floor.
546.96	4.6	I also wonder if they can measure my breathing, my respiration.
552.47	3.42	I wonder if they could measure my heart rate right now,
555.95	3.1	because my heart rate is just naturally high.
559.67	2.71	So, I can only imagine what it is right now. [Inaudible]
577.27	2.4	I wonder what went wrong with the code earlier.
580.17	1.18	I messed up.
582.76	2.56	I wonder what their code looks like.
588.68	2.65	Ten minutes to take one run, I thought.
592.51	0.78	That's crazy.
595.77	1.77	How am I going to get home after this?
597.71	1.1	By the bus?
