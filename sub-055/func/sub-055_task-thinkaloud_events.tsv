2.96	1.34	Okay, the screen says to begin.
4.39	2.36	So, I'm going to start stream of conscious talking.
7.43	1.98	I'm really curious about the choice of color on the slide.
9.7	1.13	Why is it white on gray?
11.01	7.44	Reminds me of Steve Jobs and how he really cared about design and aesthetics when designing the personal computer back in the 70s and 80s.
18.81	2.19	I watched these really fantastic documentaries.
21.21	4.85	I think they're on Apple TV plus, I guess that makes sense it’d be on Apple TV, about Steve Jobs.
26.24	3.95	And there's two Steve Jobs movies, but the first one is better, Ashton Kutcher.
30.28	1.22	He really did a fantastic job.
32.23	4.31	And I can't believe I started thinking about all of that just based on the white on gray color aesthetic.
36.99	5.9	It's a very microscope, which reminds me of the, got Mac commercials from like the early 2000s.
43.07	8.07	There was like the boring PC and the cool Mac commercial and that was like, there's always that dude, you're getting a Dell commercial for Dell computers.
51.59	2.78	I remember talking about that in this, what was her name?
54.56	1.63	My biology class in 10th grade.
56.78	0.54	Mrs. Larson.
57.5	5.13	She was a great teacher, and then she retired and she actually died from quitting smoking.
62.81	0.77	It was tragic.
64.12	1.55	She was one the best teachers had in high school.
65.76	2.58	There were a few really great high school teachers I had.
70.48	5.39	Mrs. Larson, Mr. Sutton, Mr. Dickey, they all died young right after they retired.
76.05	2.86	It was really tragic, but they were all tough but in different ways.
79.54	3.85	Mr. Sutton was cool, because he is the only teacher who would swear and talk about drinking.
83.49	3.13	But he was a really tough English teacher, and I really respected him for being tough.
87.07	1.14	But he was also hilarious.
88.66	3.76	My older brother hated him, but my brother doesn't have the same sense of humor I have.
93.15	5.87	Mr. Sutton was really sarcastic and he was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot of great stuff in his class.
99.14	3.03	I only read two of the books though, maybe even only one.
102.63	4.22	I think the only book I read was Siddhartha, and everything else I just read the spark notes for online.
107.21	1.78	I'm really not a literature person at all.
109.17	0.73	I'm a science person.
110.62	3.06	But Mr. Nikolai, actually, he was my physics teacher.
113.86	3.31	He actually looked like Einstein and it was quite remarkable.
117.35	3.4	He had this bushy mustache, and he had this really awful comb over.
120.94	1.08	He wasn't fooling anybody with it.
122.89	10.56	I didn't really like high school other than some of the cool teachers and being in church youth group, that was good.
134.09	1.54	And being in theater, theater was good.
135.81	4.63	I kind of got to be friends with some of the theater nerds, and they got me into theater later on in high school.
140.62	0.91	I wish I had done more of that.
141.98	6.8	In the years since I've thought about maybe getting to amateur theater, but I also have too many hobbies.
148.96	4.22	I also do swing dancing, and I've been doing swing dancing for like eight years.
153.36	3.81	I mean, I've lived in Maryland for nine years and no, I've lived here longer.
157.35	1.82	I've lived here since 2012.
160.57	0.81	Yeah, 2012.
161.84	1.77	Started my PhD at Hopkins in 2012.
164.24	5.29	My nose itches really bad right above my left lip.
169.64	0.61	Hey, it's not fair.
170.46	2.49	You said I'd be too busy talking to notice it itches.
173.4	3.04	But if I talk about itching, I got to talk about something else.
176.89	2.41	Like astronauts got to have problems when they’re in space.
179.48	2.17	They can’t scratch their nose.
182.24	4.17	And they're doing a space marker, an ETA for like eight hours at a time, and they can't scratch their nose.
186.53	1.54	I guess you just got to focus on something else.
189.02	3.27	Earth has got to look beautiful from the space, I hope I get to see it sometime.
193.06	3.86	But that beeping noise, I wonder what's making that noise.
197.55	4.53	Do MRI machines use liquid helium to cool down to like four Kelvin.
202.18	0.64	I've heard that they do.
203.32	2.26	Or maybe that's another type of brain imaging system.
206.22	0.49	I'm not sure.
206.89	1.72	I hope that itchy feeling goes away soon.
209.38	5.22	Yeah, there's a helium shortage crisis and that bothers me.
215.23	6.62	Everyone who produces natural gas could theoretically produce helium, but there's gotta be a market incentive for them to do that.
222.49	7.44	And the government, I would think has a strategic incentive to incentivize, like to buy helium from every natural gas producer there is.
230.48	3.62	Because helium is a very strategic gas, Earth ain't making more of it.
234.28	3.76	So, I mean it is, but very slowly because it's from the radioactive decay of uranium.
238.68	5.62	Which reminds me of the chart of the nucleids in my undergraduate physics courses at Houghton College.
245.03	2.95	And my undergraduate physics professor, Dr. Yuli was really cool.
248.43	0.86	He was an amazing teacher.
249.47	2.22	Super tough but also just really awesome.
252.33	3.31	And there was like this something called the neutron drip line.
256.18	10.3	And it was once isotopes got too heavy with regards to neutrons, like the nuclear would just like fall apart or something.
267.02	0.91	It was pretty cool.
268.11	6.99	And that led to getting an internship in undergrad at Los Alamo National Lab, the Neutron Science Center, which is a fantastic experience.
275.87	4.31	But I'm pretty sure I made the experiment worse.
280.54	4.22	I switched to geology for graduate school, which was a far better fit.
284.85	2.85	If I was an engineer and had to build bridges, I'd probably accidentally kill somebody.
288.16	1.58	It's good that I'm not doing physics anymore.
290.11	3.05	It's better for the universe than I'm doing geology instead, planetary geology.
293.34	0.46	I love space.
294.43	3.04	But that beeping noise that's still going, it's not annoying.
297.56	5.94	I can tolerate it, but I'm just curious what the physics is behind why it's beeping like that.
304.36	4.4	There's no countdown clock, so I don't know when 10 minutes is up.
309.85	1.77	It's getting faster now.
312.71	2.95	I just had Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy pop into mind.
316.75	4.89	And it's almost like Douglas Adams who wrote that sort of was like, he wrote almost dream of conscious it feels like.
321.92	8.07	It was just like this ridiculous, absurd humor about the inner galactic freeway, people having to make a bypass through earth.
330.17	2.58	It happened to inconvenience its neighborhood in England.
334.11	3.86	I feel like this is an experience that the character would have.
338.06	1.32	I can't even remember his name.
340.1	2.04	It's been so long since I've read that.
343.87	3.03	My best friend isn't into airplanes the way I am.
347.36	1.09	I think airplanes are really cool.
348.63	9.66	I wish it like in a parallel universe, I was probably like an F-18 super hornet fighter pilot for the Navy, taking off aircraft carriers and flying super sonic.
358.47	0.86	I think that'd so much fun.
360.24	0.99	My nose still itches.
362.91	1.83	And there's Velcro on the inside here.
364.92	0.72	What are the Velcros for?
366.19	2.4	There's black Velcro and white Velcro, and it's really fuzzy.
369.5	2.85	And I don’t know why you put Velcro on here, like what sticks to it?
373.08	3.22	Oh, I bet it's like a covering for the inside of the MRI machine.
377.12	6.62	Also, MRI should be called NMR because it's nuclear magnetic resonance, but the public is afraid of the word nuclear.
384.01	4.31	So, they came up with magnetic resonance imaging instead of nuclear magnetic resonance.
388.5	2.22	Even though NMR is technically more correct.
390.9	4.04	And I really think the public should be educated to not fear the word nuclear anymore.
395.8	2.18	And I wish we had more nuclear power because it is green.
398.25	2.04	It is for all intents and purposes sustainable.
401.11	4.03	And there's so much public education that needs to be done.
405.51	11.51	So often people say, not in my backyard, but literally in my backyard you could put a nuclear power plant and I'd be thrilled with it because it's clean green electricity, and really, we should go to nuclear fusion.
417.3	6.07	And the National Ignition Facility recently had a breakthrough infusion.
423.56	6.89	It's still a long way before they commercialize it, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction.
431.36	6.16	If my girlfriend was listening to this, it would confirm her suspicions that I'm a nerd, but she's a nerd too.
437.7	1.73	But in a bookish literary sort of way.
440.24	3.5	I guess nerds attract, but opposite nerds attract.
444.05	6.22	Because I'm into technical stuff, space and aviation and physics, and that kind of stuff.
450.54	1.22	All areas of science really.
452.31	3.31	And she's very much into like British literature and I tease her for it.
456.16	3.22	But we did go to England and had a really fantastic time over Thanksgiving.
460.02	4.58	It felt ironic being in Britain over American Thanksgiving, but it was still a lot of fun.
465.1	5.52	She did a semester in Oxford, and being in Oxford was just so inspiring.
470.71	0.99	I mean they filmed Harry Potter there.
472.25	1.68	And I just remember the Bodleian Library.
474.83	8.71	The Bodleian library just inspires just like, you just want to like curl up with a book or some journal articles and just nerd out all afternoon with some English tea.
484.31	1.63	And it was just so incredible.
486.49	10.29	And I remember an episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy, when he was getting an MRI scan done of his brain, and they showed video of his feet outside the NMR.
496.96	2.68	I called it an NMR, not an MRI, because that's it’s real name.
500.18	2.29	And I remember him doing this with his feet and they showed it.
502.65	0.73	Yeah, it was silly.
503.47	2.4	They showed like a sped-up picture of him scratching his feet.
506.42	1.54	I shouldn't do that because it’ll make my head wiggle.
508.59	3.31	Okay, there's still that white plus sign on the gray background.
512.85	2.95	I think Steve Jobs have words about the design aesthetic, no offense.
515.89	1.91	If you design the design aesthetic, no offense.
518.52	2.95	The beeping is still going pretty fast.
522.97	1.81	Do they ever do this to cats?
525.24	3.58	Like my cat would never stand for this, having her brain scan by an MRI.
529.0	3.67	But it'd be fascinating to see what goes on inside her kitty little brain.
533.44	2.54	She's sometimes really smart and sometimes really dumb.
536.94	1.63	And I bet you could learn a lot.
539.84	6.84	Like I would love like an experiment to try to get a cat to per inside an MRI machine, but it would never happen because cats would only be pissed off inside here.
547.5	2.45	My cat is named after one of Pluto's moons, Nix.
551.36	2.27	Pluto has these four little irregularly shaped moons.
554.22	2.54	Let's see if I can remember their names, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.
558.16	8.16	And they're all in chaotic tumbling spin states outside the orbit of Pluto's largest moon, Charon, which is itself a planetary size moon, it's round and everything.
566.78	9.39	And so, my cat Nix is named after Nix, which is in Greek mythology is actually spelled N-Y-X, but the English says it is N-I-X.
576.71	9.75	And I'm not sure exactly which god or animal or deity animal thing Nix was, but it's related to Kerberos, which is like a six or seven headed dog, I think.
586.64	4.4	And it's like one of the guard dogs of the underworld along with Pluto.
592.27	8.52	Charon is the boatman that ferries the souls across the river Styx to the underworld where Pluto is the god.
