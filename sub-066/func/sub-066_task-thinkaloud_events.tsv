2.36	1.53	Oh this thing's really loud.
5.72	1.35	I don't know when or how bad it feels.
7.14	0.94	This is weird.
9.34	1.4	It's a little close.
10.79	1.99	I think I was claustrophobic, but I'm not.
12.91	1.4	But it's still a little tight.
23.66	1.14	I don't even know what to say.
25.78	6.31	I need to make sure I get that message sent to Pastor Randall and Pastor Sam.
32.95	4.95	But it's a good thing I told Felice about it because she's always saying I don't tell her about opportunities.
38.02	2.96	So, she can't say I didn't tell her about this one.
44.08	4.43	Hopefully, that man emails me back about the application.
48.81	4.57	It's due tomorrow night and I still don't even know if I'll be able to make it.
56.08	1.7	It actually feels pretty good though.
58.38	2.74	The mat's comfortable, so at least that's good.
64.12	4.36	I don't know why I wasn't able to fall asleep last night and I've been so tired every day.
69.33	1.1	But I went to bed pretty late
70.51	3.1	and I'm trying really hard not to close my eyes and fall asleep in here.
74.18	2.56	This is like the perfect temperature to fall asleep.
81.13	4.77	I wish I could see like the scan happening right now instead of this loud sound.
85.99	0.94	It's kind of annoying.
89.5	1.88	But it's okay, I guess.
92.33	1.86	I wish I knew where the building was.
95.17	2.21	Luckily, I worked pretty close so...
98.57	2.62	It is a good thing I told my manager that I'm going in late.
106.87	1.96	I actually kind of like that job, though.
108.9	1.02	It's pretty chill.
111.95	4.55	And hopefully it pays well because I still have no idea, like how that's all going to go down.
116.66	3.12	And there's other students that work there, and actually I saw a friend there.
120.35	1.35	I didn't even know she worked there.
127.35	1.07	This seems really annoying.
130.45	1.76	Is it going to go the full 10 minutes?
133.85	0.56	Probably.
138.72	1.49	I'm ready for summer.
140.51	5.11	I'm actually ready to graduate, but i still have quite a while to go.
146.72	4.12	I really want to travel before I go like into my masters or something.
152.06	8.81	Go either back to Kenya and maybe for like two months or something, and then go to Greece or something.
163.17	3.86	I'd have to save up a lot, so I should probably start on that.
169.41	1.9	I wonder if my siblings are at home.
173.2	2.84	They said they didn't have school yesterday, which, lucky for them but
177.75	0.93	they're back to it.
178.73	2.74	So, it's probably so quiet there,
182.2	5.78	cause I'm usually the one that makes the most, not noise but just keep things lively and friendly.
189.13	4.65	But they come like every day, which gets kind of annoying, but they're my siblings so.
199.03	1.69	I think I'm actually doing pretty good.
200.82	2.1	I usually have a hard time staying still but
203.56	0.95	this is comfortable.
204.56	2.14	And there's a decent amount of space.
207.28	1.71	I think my arm is up, so it's not bad.
213.13	4.55	Oh, I saw some med students coming out of the medical building yesterday, and I was like, wow.
219.15	1.85	I couldn't imagine that being...
221.11	3.44	The good thing, I changed that because that's just too much.
226.26	1.11	It's just way too much.
231.2	6.88	And I'm glad I talked to Ms. Doran about my career because she gave me a lot of useful advice.
239.04	4.36	And Stacy, I got a lot of advice from her too.
245.28	4.8	So I'm not the only one who's a little bit on the fence about still going into medicine.
256.46	1.39	This is still playing okay.
267.84	2.49	Oh, doctor, I don't even remember his name.
272.19	1.61	Well, anyway, that class is actually really nice.
274.23	4.66	Yesterday, there was a kid that sat next to me and was like coughing the whole time and I was like, please cover your mouth.
280.42	2.63	But I couldn't move because it was like during class.
285.45	7.49	And I went pretty early, so at least I was on time, but that was just really annoying.
292.97	1.15	I couldn't wait to leave.
294.85	1.07	That was just too much.
298.89	1.8	My other classes are okay.
301.33	6.53	I'm glad I have some that are online, but I kind of want to see the professor in person and like office hours.
308.36	2.17	But that campus is a little too far.
314.18	2.05	My computing class is actually pretty nice though.
317.66	6.52	It's not boring, it's not interesting, I'm just there because I was told it's an easy way so...
325.7	1.62	Hopefully, I was told the truth.
331.87	1.61	I feel like I'm just now waking up.
333.56	4.45	I had such a hard time getting up this morning,
339.28	6.17	but hopefully this sound will keep me awake the entire time, and just being here.
347.84	4.85	I can't imagine going through like this again, like MRI and all of that stuff.
352.76	0.86	But I have to go through.
354.77	2.1	Likely he doesn't have to do that as much anymore.
356.97	10.1	It's just like routine appointments to see how his body's accepted everything, but this is still a lot.
369.64	4.29	But at least the air is nice, and I'm a lot more calmer.
374.0	3.09	At first, when I was getting in, I was like, oh, this is a lot,
378.52	3.51	but my heart rate's kind of normalized now.
386.8	1.51	I hope Ricky's doing good, though.
389.54	5.77	I think she's still not at home, but I don't really know where she is.
396.17	1.05	I don't think she's doing good.
397.25	0.88	I should probably ask.
399.59	0.67	It's been a while.
401.16	2.1	I don't want them to get a lot concerned.
405.44	4.16	I should also start thinking about, oh, my goodness, storage.
410.24	6.33	This semester is going to go by really fast, and I should find somebody to share it with so it's not as much.
417.01	3.28	I really hope I get a refund back this semester because that'd be nice.
421.39	7.74	I doubt it because I still kind of have a balance on my account, but I hope.
432.99	1.56	I really want to get into like finance.
434.58	6.36	So, I'm interested in healthcare, but I don't know, maybe a little investing.
441.01	5.66	I should probably start learning some things, or like go to my bank and ask questions and stuff because that seems really interesting.
447.8	1.44	That seems really interesting.
450.61	0.83	My eyes are closing.
451.61	1.42	Okay, I have to stay awake.
455.99	1.3	I didn't realize how long 10 minutes was.
457.31	1.3	This is a long time.
461.35	2.03	But I'm proud of myself for staying still.
468.34	1.28	Is the sound getting louder?
471.36	1.46	Maybe it's just because I'm not talking.
474.53	3.33	I feel like I should have gotten used to it, but also it's not as loud.
480.21	3.41	Anyway, Liz looks like she's having a lot of fun in college though.
484.19	1.9	I'm glad she's like in there for first year.
487.48	0.8	It's nice.
489.27	2.18	Shelput Arena looks really, really nice.
491.96	5.5	Actually, I haven't been inside, because I have to pay since I'm not a student, which I'm not going to do.
497.53	2.47	But it still looks really nice.
501.7	2.9	I really hope we get somebody good for a spring fair
506.68	6.12	cause last year was not the best, but it's okay.
513.15	3.05	Why are they spending more money renovating the library when they could...?
516.76	4.87	I feel like they should just spend that money to add some more study spaces.
522.44	1.94	cause I feel like it's already crammed a little bit.
524.74	1.69	And they still haven't finished the student center.
527.73	2.08	I don't think they'll get done in time.
534.29	3.1	cause I looked this morning and it doesn't look like they made much progress.
537.47	3.62	But I'm not in construction, so I don't really know.
553.09	1.99	I'm sorry, but this sound is just crazy.
555.52	0.92	Is this how it is?
557.61	4.59	I wish I was in the room when he was getting up done, but I couldn't be obviously.
563.92	5.96	But this is a lot, but at least I can stretch a little bit.
576.46	1.64	I haven't seen Mariam in a long time.
578.77	7.25	She's still on campus, but I feel like I should have crossed her a little sometime.
589.71	1.49	And I missed the meeting yesterday.
591.71	2.52	Oh, well, there'll be another one.
597.19	7.72	I wish I could have gone to the third campus again, but I have things to do.
