0.07	4.5	Okay, so I believe I just counted to ten, so now I’m gonna start talking.
5.07	5.03	Um…currently I’m thinking about my feet and how they are raised and it’s a little bit of a weird sensation.
10.16	6.87	I feel like I’m the…my toes, my toesies are definitely gonna be falling asleep soon but I think that’s going to be okay.
17.54	2.78	Um, I haven’t really looked around my little box yet,
20.45	9.68	but I’m thinking about how when my mom had to get an MRI- I think it was an MRI- because she had some sort of thyroid can- not cancer, goodness.
30.28	3.04	But no, she had some sort of thyroid problem so she had an MRI.
33.75	4.48	And my mom is claustrophobic so my mom was telling me about how horrible of an experience it was,
38.37	3.78	but this really doesn't seem to be too bad, other than the beeping noise.
42.68	6.52	Um, I think my earplug in my left ear isn’t doing as much as my earplug in my right ear, but that’s okay.
49.25	2.47	Both of them feel kinda comfy, kinda weird…
52.3	3.89	but, you know, nothing that I’m not too unused to.
57.17	3.71	Uh, I’m looking at the ceiling, looking at these very nice security cameras,
60.99	2.15	reminds me when I worked at Kohl’s.
63.52	8.28	Yeah, you were trained and had to spot shoplifters and they showed us the security cameras and it was kind of creepy because they have eyes, like, all over the store.
73.21	9.8	But it was kinda cool but one of the things that said was like a signal of someone shoplifting was someone looking- not looking at the tags and just putting it in their cart or someone…
83.42	20.96	which I thought was kind of like, fake news, because sometimes when I’m just shopping just to like try things on, I don’t really look at the price tag either because I’m not gonna buy it, so I just put things that I like in my cart, and sometimes I don’t even look at the size because if it’s on the front of the rack you assume that it’s a size small and if it’s on the back you assume it’s the size extra large or whatever.
104.8	8.35	So you can normally pretty well tell, so you don’t really need to look at the size, and they have a bunch of different clues and things like that, and all that was fake.
113.19	3.66	But one time I did see someone shoplift and I feel so guilty about this.
116.95	4.24	So I was- I’m a cashier, so I was just upfront scanning people out.
121.22	3.86	Someone came up to me, and she was like “There’s this shady guy in the shoes”.
125.15	12.03	And I was like…well, I’m not willing to do anything about that because people tell me stuff like that all the time, and I- I also live in a very white town, so I’m like, you’re probably just being racist.
137.49	11.02	But then someone left, they like stocked their backpack full of like five pairs of shoes and ran out the door and it was beeping, and I can’t do anything when someone steals, so I was just like, “Have a nice day!”
148.58	7.53	But the really sad part is that he went with his kid, so his kid was also havin’ a backpack full of shoes and was following him.
156.4	12.02	So I kinda feel bad for that kid and I think about him sometimes, like if that’s your parent role-model, I don't really know what he’s doing in his life but I hope he’s not stealing shoes, and maybe he’s working at Kohl’s.
168.86	6.86	Not that working as a cashier is a great job, but my dream job when I was little- so kindergarten year had I always asked “What’s your dream job?”
176.16	2.61	And everyone said like, a princess or an astronaut or whatever.
179.6	4.42	Well, I’m the youngest of nine, and so my older sisters were cashiers at Big Y.
184.49	12.28	But I didn’t know the word cashier, I called them “boopers” because when they scan an item it makes a “boop” sound and I was a very intelligent five-year-old so therefore the job title must be a “booper”.
197.28	13.73	Um, so when my kindergarten teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I said a “booper”, and she had no idea what I was saying and I started crying because I also had…kind of have a speech impediment, so I can’t really say my “R’s”.
211.4	6.11	So I thought she just couldn’t understand me but it turns out it’s just a fake word, no one actually calls them “boopers” because they’re cashiers.
217.9	3.51	But then I got the job as a cashier and like fulfilling my life dream.
221.8	2.27	Another life dream of mine is be a waitress,
224.1	1.39	so I applied to Friendly’s.
225.57	2.69	I think I applied to Friendly’s, maybe I didn’t end up applying.
228.62	9.04	But I didn’t work there, I forget whether it’s because I didn’t apply or whether they didn’t want me but I kind of- always wanted to be a waitress, tell me why.
237.68	3.3	I don’t know why my life dream’s so mudane.
245.04	1.81	But I also dream a lot sometimes.
246.96	6.13	Now I’m really looking at the word “attention” and like, my eyeballs just focused again, so that’s kind of strange.
257.59	5.72	yeah, my elbow’s kinda resting off the pad, my thumb on my right hand feels a little bit cold.
263.99	6.46	Um…I have to go home, and then I have to study and clean my room, I haven’t cleaned my room in like two weeks.
270.52	5.56	It’s a little bit of like, a depression room right now- definitely very, very, dirty, I have clothes everywhere.
276.8	7.69	One of my friends walked into my room when it was clean, um, and was like, “Wow it looks like a boutique” because I have a closet and then I have a second closet.
284.53	4.74	I have a actual clothes rack in my room because I have too many clothes that can’t fit in my closet.
289.74	3.75	And then I have a shoe rack, and then I also have like shoes in my closet, obviously.
293.51	1.58	I have thirty-nine pairs of shoes.
295.53	2.56	And then I also have my posters hanging up on the wall.
298.49	10.97	And when I first started hanging them I thought it was really, really sad because they kept on falling down but not because, like, I hung them up incorrectly, but because my wall literally fell down.
309.51	7.3	So I taped- command hooked the thing to the wall and then just a chunk of the wall fell off with my command hook.
316.97	5.14	So my command hook was still firmly attached to the wall, just the wall was not attached to the wall.
322.47	12.9	It was kind of sad, so my house is a little bit falling apart, I mean it’s not really my house, it’s someone else’s house, I’m just renting it, so I don’t really know what they’re going to do about that, but I’m gonna call that not my problem.
335.69	5.92	I don’t know if I’m going to stay in this house, I mean it’s really close to campus and it’s pretty cheap so it’s not bad.
342.08	2.6	But at the same time it is falling apart a little bit.
345.5	11.91	And this morning when I woke up- so I turn off the heat when I go to bed because I’m cheap, um, and so I went to bed and turned off the heat and I woke up this morning, it was fifty-eight degrees in my house.
357.51	2.66	It was FIFTY EIGHT DEGREES in my house.
360.28	12.88	So I turn on my heat because my roommate’s from India and she gets cold all the time and- even though I bought her a space heater, so she’s definitely using the space heater in her bedroom, but I don't want her feet to be cold when she goes to like make breakfast in the morning because the kitchen has tile on it.
373.67	3.59	The rest of the house is carpet and the carpet is DISGUSTING.
377.3	5.03	My previous landlord was like “Oh yeah I did a cleaning, I totally cleaned everything before you guys came.”
382.64	8.13	This is fake news because I went and I rented a carpet cleaner and I was only able to do tw- three passes of the carpet.
391.75	7.37	But even by the third pass, the carpet was like still turning up, like dog and animal fur and it was black.
399.95	1.45	It was literally- I was- it was black.
401.47	1.09	It was not gray.
402.98	2.32	It was not like “oh a little bit”- it was black.
405.43	1.04	A hundred percent black.
406.6	1.45	And I was like this is disgusting.
408.1	8.22	And I want to go and get another carpet cleaner, but I don’t have a car, and I don’t want to walk through the streets of Baltimore with a fucking carpet cleaner.
416.41	9.79	Plus, that just wastes time because you can only rent it for a certain number of hours, and if half of those hours are just me walking back and forth with the carpet cleaner, that’s not a very good investment.
426.49	3.83	But I do want to carpet clean my house again because it’s disgusting.
430.39	3.07	We used to walk around in our bare feet, our feet got dirty.
433.51	2.62	Our feet were black just from walking around our apartment.
436.18	3.59	It was disgusting, definitely not a fan, zero out of ten.
439.83	3.59	My previous landlord sucked, um, not a big fan.
443.86	3.6	But he sold the house, so we have a new landlord.
447.56	1.69	His name is Mike, he’s pretty cool.
449.31	2.51	He’s young, he reminds me a lot of my older brother Chris.
452.35	1.93	Uh, he has a kid, a toddler.
454.59	4.7	My older brother Chris does not have a toddler, so, really sad.
459.31	6.45	I always thought I’d be an aunt before I graduated high school, and then I wasn’t even aunt before I graduated college.
465.8	4.3	And the way things are looking, I’m still not gonna be a aunt by the time I graduate grad school,
470.58	5.89	which is kinda sad because my oldest brother is like thirty-seven and still no kids.
476.51	2.49	But everyone is slowly getting engaged.
479.09	5.45	But my sister Liz isn’t engaged yet and my sister Katie is all like, “Lish get engaged, Lish get-”
484.59	27.39	but like, I feel like that’s definitely a her-and-John situation and you know I kind of stopped pressuring people but like in my head- obviously I would never tell her to get engaged, but in my head stop pressuring people to get engaged because I started dating someone for the first time in like my whole life and I’m like, “Well, you know, if they don’t really wanna get engaged, then- then I don’t really want to get-” not that I don’t love my boyfriend, because I do, but like, definitely do not want to be engaged.
512.4	5.28	Um, so I feel like that’s all her decision, her and John, though I do love John.
517.77	4.27	He got me a Dunkin Donuts gift card for Christmas which is very very very sweet.
522.39	7.56	You might be like, “Oh, that’s a gift card, it’s lame”, but first of all, like, half of my siblings didn’t get me a gift and second of all, I love Dunkin Donuts.
530.02	5.41	I go to Dunkin Donuts all the time, except now I don’t have a car, so I don’t really go to Dunkin Donuts that much.
535.53	13.99	I went to Dunkin Donuts once, on like National Coffee thing Day I think, but I like biked for like, thirty minutes each way to get my freaking coffee and it was not an enjoyable experience, and then…on the way there wasn’t too bad, but the way back was uphill.
549.6	1.39	It was really not fun,
551.02	2.45	I’m not a very athletic person,
553.9	17.06	so biking uphill for that long was not good, and I was worried about my coffee spilling, and by the time I got home I could barely even enjoy it because all the ice cubes were melted, and now it’s cold, so like the ice cubes wouldn’t melt, but it would be even worse in the experience and really just not that great.
571.01	3.47	But I do love Dunkin, I used to give her in like two seconds.
575.5	14.7	I also tried to get a job at Dunkin but by the time they processed my application- this is not my fault, I applied so much in advance- but the time they processed my application, it was like, I have a week and a half left to work, and I told them that, and they’re like “We’re not gonna hire you.”
590.28	3.05	And I’m like, kinda rude but a little bit understandable.
593.39	1.24	They're like, “The learning curve!”
594.68	5.91	I’m like, “Well, you know, I feel like as h-hard as working in a fast food industry
