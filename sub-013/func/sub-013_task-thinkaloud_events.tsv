3.81	10.89	I don't know if it's just me but I can see like this like the letters are appearing yellow and then there’s this like blue light to the left of the letters that I’m looking at
14.7	0.81	It's so weird
15.69	2.13	I wonder if it's just my contacts
18.75	6.88	Also my contacts are making it like blurry and like when I got into this thing I got slight vertigo ish
26.58	1.95	This noise is really comforting
28.8	7.71	I know it’s like kind of annoying but it’s like so consistent that it drowns out the sound of my own voice so I can’t really hear myself which is nice
37.46	2.04	The thing before sounded like a heartbeat
39.5	1.0	I really liked that
41.54	3.99	Why am I always like the wrong temperature?
45.53	2.05	I feel like I’m never like the perfect temperature
48.3	6.87	Right now I’m actually like okay but I’m simultaneously warm and cold mostly cold but simultaneously both
56.09	0.59	It's so weird
58.54	6.5	I just realized that I haven’t told any of my friends that I’m doing this today like none of my friends know where I am
65.13	5.39	They think I’m probably just like on campus somewhere doing something normal like studying
71.93	9.27	I just like they don't I don’t know how I feel with them right now just cause like I love them but then there's just like weird tension going on
81.47	7.89	And like they’re all in the same dorm right next to each other so they all get super close and then they're like I'm by myself in AMR three
90.08	5.49	It kinda sucks that way but I feel like I’ve always just been like on the outside of friend groups
96.43	4.72	This one was like funny because I thought for like a little bit I was like oh I was like inside the friend group
101.16	3.98	I was like one of the most inside people and it felt really good
105.88	4.58	But it’s different now which is okay like we're just freshman year
110.91	2.58	I’m making friends we’re meeting new people still
114.08	10.66	I definitely feel like the my friend group like the closest ones that I am to they like they're like definitely very closed off from other outside people
125.26	3.72	It feels like whereas I keep trying to meet new people and stuff
129.16	4.27	Oh shoot I have to prepare for my model UN debate this Saturday
134.24	1.21	Ugh I really don’t wanna do that
135.46	2.13	I also have to like pay dues which sucks
139.0	2.16	I didn’t realize everything had dues here
141.48	0.72	I mean it makes sense
142.38	2.22	Back in high school I had stuff like that too
144.7	2.38	I had to pay a shit ton for model UN conferences
147.9	1.22	But it's still very annoying
149.39	2.04	Hopefully I can get my mom to pay for it
151.98	2.18	I feel bad asking her for all of that though
156.56	2.4	I have so much to do and so little time
159.69	8.79	Like for the class that I'm missing I’m gonna see if can get my friend who’s the TA to put my attendance on a sheet so I don't lose that point
168.62	2.49	But I still have to do the in-class activity
171.65	5.13	But it’s MATLAB so it’s like confusing and we just started it and I don’t understand it
177.59	1.41	I don’t really like the teacher
179.18	6.85	Everyone’s kind of like everyone likes her but she’s has a style that I just don’t like so that’s annoying but
187.55	1.68	Oof my eyes are tired
189.5	4.63	It’s fine I did not sleep enough last night which is very dumb cause I could could’ve slept a ton
194.68	7.52	I just like didn’t cause I am a college student and apparently like we have to have fucked up sleep schedules
203.16	1.17	It’s really funny
205.29	6.3	Like I was got home from dance at I don’t know eleven-thirty eleven-forty-five
211.88	1.23	I took a shower
213.31	10.89	And then instead of going into bed and reading or even just like going to bed at like twelve or twelve-thirty I then went out to the library to do more work from twelve-thirty to one-thirty
225.11	7.52	And then I walked back but I did finish my essay last night so that was good just cause I was nervous about the amount of work that I have but
233.57	2.41	Ugh I still have what do I have to do?
237.2	10.75	I have to do this I have to do all of the computing work that I’m missing today and the homework that I don’t particularly understand but have to finish it
248.87	4.06	And then I have to pri- edit and print out my essay
253.11	5.49	I need to get Demitri to give me his card for that for printing and all I’m not about to pay for printing
260.73	1.9	And then I have to prepare for this debate
262.68	3.04	I was thinking about like the crisis arc that I was gonna do
266.58	6.11	And I’m the VP of a public relations company but I don't really know what I wanna what my goal is
273.05	2.04	Is my goal to prop up the company?
275.37	3.53	Or is my goal to like become the CEO myself or something?
279.76	10.66	But as a public relations person, I either can I’m either gonna decide to go with the snitch route and relea- just like leak stuff to the press and be really destructive
291.28	9.44	Or im gonna be the per- like the righteous person that like speaks to the press and kind of bashes people in the committee for doing things wrong so that’ll be fun
302.03	1.41	But it kinda it’s annoying
303.62	5.31	I feel like I was so good at everything in high school compared to my peers and here obviously like I’m not
309.65	6.71	So Katy, she like won the outstanding endowed award for our last mock debate
317.36	11.61	And she’s really good and I completely understand that and I’m happy for her but it feels like I don’t know why I it feels silly like I feel like I should’ve gotten it
329.42	5.22	At the same time like I did a shitty job for some of my um debates
335.27	1.5	It wasn’t my best debate like
337.63	4.81	I put a ton of effort into it and stuff but it still is like annoying
342.62	5.12	I don’t know it feels very entitled to feel like I should win something but um
348.11	5.39	I I definitely have that form of like academic need for academic validation
354.68	6.01	And the fact that I’m not doing as well that I’m not as into model UN as other people is really making me question if i should stay
360.96	3.09	But then I hate quitting cause it feels like im giving up on something
364.86	1.5	Also my fomo kicks in
367.49	3.63	I have such bad fomo like my friends are going out to lunch right now
371.94	2.0	Actually no I've gotten better with that
374.17	9.25	I don't feel that bad about the missing out on them going out to lunch right now just cause they spend a shit ton of money on stuff I wouldn't spend money on
385.87	4.08	Like I dont understand how people communicate
390.86	3.9	I’m a how how often am I supposed to talk to my friends?
396.25	3.0	Not in person because in person I'm like really good I feel like
399.52	9.38	But how often am I supposed to text and FaceTime and call my friends when they literally live half a mile away not even half a mile away like two a minute walk away from me
409.63	1.5	It doesnt really make sense to me
411.49	8.89	I wish I grew up in a time when we didn't have social media and technology and instant communication cause it makes me feel like im being left behind
420.7	1.63	Oh damn wait that’s fomo
423.1	1.32	Yea I definitely have fomo
425.59	2.23	Uh I'm excited to go back for Thanksgiving
429.22	6.9	I definitely feel like I'm super excited to eat well but there’s a part of me that’s like worried cause i dont feel like I'm in
437.68	4.35	I feel like I'm not in eating the best and in the best shape that I could be in
442.3	3.81	I mean it's normal to gain weight when you move to a new place like the freshman fifteen
447.06	6.47	But I'm just trying to avoid that and feel good about my body while also loving myself but then also being healthy
453.71	2.22	It’s it's a tough balance
457.43	3.08	Oh this thing on my middle finger its like squeezing my middle finger
460.7	4.17	I don't know why I just realized that like suddenly I'm very aware of that
466.37	8.16	I'm happy that i remembered to go to the bathroom before this because I have a small bladder and that would've been terrible if I needed to go to the bathroom in the middle
478.16	0.81	Im due for my-
479.34	2.55	Yea wait I'm due for my period any day now
482.2	10.39	I think it's today actually my app says but I've been like super weird lately like I have not had a regular schedule which I normally have so who knows
493.68	0.91	But it's so annoying
496.45	2.72	I've always wondered what it would be like to have an IUD
500.42	2.13	I heard it was painful to put in so
503.64	4.76	I know like after the um senate uh was it after what bill?
508.49	4.49	Or oh no after Amy Coney Barrett was appointed I think that was it
513.26	12.33	But a lo- a bunch of my girls in my high school in my grade they all got IUDs just in case the supreme court did something to deregulate it after so that was kind of that was kind of funny
526.82	10.24	I'm surprised that you're allowed to do an MRI with an IUD in just because like if it's metal is it gonna like hurt or suck it like twist it or whatever?
537.25	9.29	I don't really know how MRIs work but I assume that it just like it's magnetic so it pulls the metal out which is dangerous cause then it could like rip through your body or something
547.77	2.76	It can't be that strong I guess cause it's pretty small but
551.58	5.67	It doesnt really make sense to me why you could do it with an IUD but you can't do it with like other knee plating or stuff
559.11	3.69	It's so weird that I can see out of where I'm lying right now
562.92	3.14	I think thats what's fucking with my brain like
567.29	0.7	Oh I wonder if I could see-
568.26	1.77	I can't see my toes thats unfortunate
570.21	2.99	I wish I could like stretch my legs out and see my toes
573.75	0.95	That would be funny
576.74	1.27	My feet are so fucked up
578.78	3.45	Like they feel better tod- this morning but its so terrible
582.68	2.13	Last night with dance and everything
585.09	1.95	Why can't I just have normal arches?
587.77	1.4	I have the worst arches
590.22	3.13	And the tendonitis is definitely flaring up with bhangra
594.39	11.61	I feel like I feel like I'm more myself when I'm with that dance team than I'm with almost everyone including the um the people that i call
