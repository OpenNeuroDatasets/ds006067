3.47	5.17	Um, it’s a lot louder than I thought it would be in here
10.13	4.36	But I think I’m pretty excited though because I’ve never gotten an MRI scan before
15.13	5.3	And I watched all of Grey’s Anatomy and it always seems really cool so it’s gonna be pretty fun.
21.15	9.51	Uh, honestly, I watch a lot of Grey’s Anatomy and in that show everyone always finds they have like secret tumors in their brain
31.06	1.75	So if that happens that would kind of be a bummer.
32.82	7.25	But I mean it’s cool that I would find out in a freaking MRI scan rather than 20 years down the road I guess.
41.31	12.98	Uh, on the way here I ran into Jeremy after I saw him at Levering for lunch with Kathy and he was- I don’t know.
54.3	7.2	Everytime I talk to him it’s like I just talk- I talk about my life for like 20 minutes and he kinda just lets me talk about my life for 20 minutes.
61.53	7.53	He doesn’t actually ask- like talk about his own life and I just feel like it’s like a therapy session which is fine
69.15	6.74	But I wonder if he gets anything out of that because I’m just talking about what my plans are for the next semester in the school year.
75.9	4.98	Oh, he’s actually going, I guess, he’s going to Newport which I feel like had arrested development.
82.37	1.46	Learned that at least and that was pretty cool.
84.6	12.08	Katie has a house in Newport, and I haven’t talked to Katie in like a couple months since I’ve transferred and I don’t think-
96.82	10.53	I mean, well, Lily, I talk to Lily more often and I’m just surprised how much that friendship’s lasted since coming out of college– since coming to college out of UofA.
108.76	7.85	But um, yeah, made me realize that I definitely value Lily’s friendship over Katie’s.
117.06	11.29	I feel like every time Katie talks to me she just wants to know, just wants to tell me how great her life is going and how hard her classes are to prove that she’s actually- she works hard in school,
129.03	5.76	But to be frank, I kind of don’t care how hard her Orgo class is cause I feel like I have enough problems on my plate here.
138.32	12.38	Uh, I haven’t seen Ty since this last winter break actually because he didn’t even come home for summer cause he’s in Boston, but I saw Max this summer and that was cool.
150.71	7.46	He- He reached out to me which was nice, although he didn’t respond after I sent him something, so I don’t know how that conversation went, but I guess I’ll see them at winter break.
158.97	8.3	And, I don’t know, I kind of feel more justified in that I’m at Hopkins now rather than UofA.
167.81	12.65	Because it’s another school so I feel like I can afford to contribute to the conversation and whatnot which is probably I need to find validation outside of what school I go to but that’s just where I am now.
182.38	11.2	The screen- the instructions on the screen are kind of blurry and I feel like it’s the resolution of the screen and not my contacts because…
195.02	3.62	I feel like everything else looks pretty ok, I don’t know.
198.86	5.9	I definitely do need new contacts though because I’ve been wearing these same contacts for like 3 months and I’m only supposed to be wearing them for 2 weeks
205.33	6.98	Which I don’t feel like is that bad cause they don’t hurt when I put them in or anything but my vision is going down I think.
213.18	3.27	Probably because I spend like 10 hours on my phone a day.
217.67	12.0	Not on my phone actually, I spend it on my laptop and my ipad and I’d say like 50% of that is actually schoolwork and 50% is not actual schoolwork and I could definitely be doing better things with my time but that’s okay.
230.76	2.31	I don’t know why I’m so embarrassed–
233.79	11.83	I remember in like 4th grade I was embarrassed to tell my parents I needed the stronger prescription and my dad made a really big deal about it
246.98	8.1	And I had to tell my mom at the ice skating rink– roller skating rink and passed away right after cause I was embarrassed about it
255.09	9.73	And my dad didn’t– I mean he would just say like- have me come up to the kid’s bathroom which they painted orange and asked if I could read this painting
264.83	3.35	And I couldn’t, and he was like yeah you need new glasses and that was the end of that.
268.97	1.6	I don’t know why I made such a big deal about it.
271.04	3.63	Although, I made a big deal out of my retainer too when I broke that.
274.94	9.38	And if I just told my parents I probably could’ve gotten a new one, but now it’s too late cause we’ve moved and I can’t go back and just get a new retainer and now my teeth are probably shifting.
287.06	4.03	And then the braces were for nothing and that was like 2 thousand dollars.
292.18	8.01	I don’t know which is uh kind of a lot of money to spend on braces I don't know.
300.31	1.32	Probably worth more than that actually.
302.99	8.03	And college is so expensive too my parents are paying for that so that’s like another 80 thousand dollars a year down the drain.
311.91	4.85	Well, cause if I were at UofA still, I could get paid to go to college.
316.77	1.49	I get paid 10 thousand dollars.
319.78	8.48	I want to go to med school anyway so what’s the point in paying so much money for undergrad if I’m just gonna pay more money for med school?
328.35	8.54	Unless I get into NYU but that is like not happening because I need a perfect MCAT score practically, and I don’t really wanna do that.
337.06	7.47	Although I think I’m gonna like take it that summer and that’ll be really fun to go back home this summer and take the MCAT so I’ll study for the MCAT with my family there,
344.54	9.66	and I can like do my own stuff and live an actual life rather than staying in Baltimore and being confined to my apartment and not wanting to go outside so I don’t get mugged.
355.54	14.33	And uh, I probably should probably look into shadow but I mean I don’t- there is Mayo in Phoenix although I don’t really think it’s that much impressive if I go to Mayo as opposed to like UofA.
370.31	3.98	And my lip keeps touching the mic and it’s- I wonder if that’s bad.
375.03	15.75	But um, yeah I feel like I mean I should probably start doing research too because I mean I’ve got like 300 hours I think from the summer which was fun, but I didn’t get my name on a paper,
390.79	9.8	and like I don’t really have tangible experience, well I don’t have tangible stuff to talk about for college med school apps so it’s probably good to think about that soon
400.72	4.31	because if I don’t want to take a gap year I gotta do a lot of stuff.
405.04	7.41	Although, I guess I mean I guess I got clinical because the children’s hospital volunteering counts but I literally don’t do anything.
412.46	9.13	I mean yesterday I cleaned some toys, I held some babies and some 7 year-old painted my nails and did my makeup so I don’t really know how that counts as clinical.
421.81	6.37	I mean, I talk to the parents like 30 minutes out of the 4 hours I’m there and that’s really it.
428.25	5.85	That’s the only interaction I have with actual adults and when i’m not just playing with kids, but I don't know.
434.53	5.58	The setting’s kinda cool it makes me feel like I’m in a rocketship like in the movie, uh, with Matt Damon.
441.66	1.89	Not Gravity…The Martian!
443.68	2.51	Oh my god by Andy Weir I think the book is by
446.91	6.75	That was really good but um, the like, the mirrors with the TV and whatnot was pretty cool.
453.68	7.46	Reminds me of a toy I had where it was like a spyscope where you could see different angles which was fun.
467.47	1.86	My brother Joseph!
470.08	7.05	Joseph asked me to set up the Secret Santa day and that was fun, and I was gonna set it up anyways, like I was actually thinking about setting up today
477.15	10.8	cause it’s November 1st and I was like oh how fitting before, right after Halloween, beginning of uh like Christmas kind of is coming up soon so I thought it would be appropriate and then he texted me which is cool.
488.09	5.44	But I wish I had done it first I mean I thought of it first so like I only did it because my brother asked me to but it’s all good
493.89	6.6	and my Grandma’s gonna do it and I got Rachel which is gonna be cool because she’s easy to get and I’ve gotten her before and I know what she wants
500.6	2.82	and she just had this really pretty dress from Antropologie she wanted.
503.43	3.72	I don’t really know which one it is because I just know that she said it but I can definitely find out.
507.35	4.44	Also she’s coming to visit in like a month and I haven’t planned anything for that, but I mean like how hard could it be?
513.54	3.11	Like we’ll go to Peabody, we’ll go to Inner Harbor, I don’t even know,
518.31	6.38	but uh Joseph said that he’s upset about who he got and he wants to trade, well he wants to re-draw and I’m definitely not re-drawing
524.75	11.03	because I don’t want to get someone bad like someone hard like my mom or my dad or my grandma, but he said that he wants to trade, well he said he wants to get re-draw and I said that we could trade
536.23	5.45	so how am I even gonna have time to really like think of a really good gift?
541.78	12.8	So I’m flying out on Christmas Eve which is cheaper so it’s fine but I’m going to have to be at the airport for like 24 hours because I’m gonna get kicked out of the dorms and I’ll just sleep at the airport.
556.93	3.15	And everyone else is like oh, you should just rebook the tickets
560.11	7.34	but I’m like I don’t really wanna have my parents pay an extra hundred dollars so I can fly out the day before like I can just stay at the airport it’s not such a big deal.
568.37	7.67	And then I can stay there for a whole month which is pretty fun because um I can’t wait to get my car and spend time with the family and my dog
576.09	7.03	which I’m pretty sure we’re gonna give to my aunt soon which is really sad because no one else likes it but me but I’m in college and I can’t bring her here
583.19	8.79	but I can hang out with her for a month and I can actually like finally do stuff I like to do rather than just school and clubs and stuff.
591.99	3.72	Like, I can actually have like hang out with my childhood friends.
595.99	6.99	Well, not childhood, I say high school friends cause like we’ve done high school but not childhood at all, and I can have a good time.
