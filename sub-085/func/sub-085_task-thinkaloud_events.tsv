2.54	3.72	It's kind of strange in here because it's very loud.
7.94	6.89	I feel pressure in my head and it's just, I feel like it's just a really strange feeling.
17.23	10.35	It was also kind of funny during the audio that was played earlier, one of the person talking mentioned the word Emily,
27.77	9.22	which is my name, and I also heard Utah, which is also where I'm from, so I guess that's kind of a strange coincidence.
39.94	11.62	Other than that, later today I'm going to go home, I'm going to take a shower, probably going to eat some food, hopefully I can still make it to the pathology event.
51.79	13.11	I really want to grab whatever free food they have, hopefully it's ecuban, but we shall see how soon this event ends, and then see where we go from there.
67.93	9.8	And then when I get home, I'll probably take a shower, probably do some Anki, and then maybe I'll do some research.
78.6	3.59	I told Allie I was going to finish her manuscript by today,
82.55	2.45	but we'll see how it goes.
85.5	7.75	I'm also really excited for spring break, I think spring break will be a good break from school.
95.29	5.17	I'm going to be flying to Utah to see Keith, and hopefully we can do fun stuff.
102.09	2.51	I'm really glad that he made a reservation for dinner,
105.51	1.62	so I'm really looking forward to that.
108.4	2.72	And yeah, we shall see.
112.07	5.22	Hopefully Sonia's also free, I think it'll be fun to hang out with her.
118.15	1.17	She seems pretty stressed,
119.46	5.63	I hope that Jack is actually okay with his family affair.
127.35	16.48	I think it'll be fun to see friends before I come back here and start my dedicated period, which I'm kind of looking forward to because then I have nothing else to worry about and I can just study and take steps.
144.31	2.1	So, looking forward to that.
148.86	10.16	Other things I am excited about is just this weekend not having to worry about anything and just sleeping in late.
160.61	10.79	I don't know, for some reason I keep on waking up really early this week, and I'm still sleeping really late, so I feel like I'm not really getting a good quality sleep.
172.9	12.79	So, hopefully this weekend I can sleep more and maybe hang out with some friends, do some fun stuff, but I'm not sure.
185.82	5.94	And then I might also go grocery shopping this weekend and start some meal prep.
193.26	11.68	I've been wanting to cook some Thai food, maybe some Chinese food with my roommates, but I guess it's just been super busy these past few weeks,
205.21	2.79	so hopefully we can cook something together.
209.22	2.95	Or I could also go to dim sum with them, which would be fun.
214.35	3.53	I haven't really tried any good dim sum restaurants here in Baltimore,
219.46	7.81	but I think they want to go to a dim sum restaurant called...
229.04	9.25	I actually forgot the name of it, but it's in Ellicott City, so I think it would be really fun to just go and hang out.
241.92	12.67	And then I am kind of worried about missing my flight to Utah because there's a layover and it's only about 50 minutes,
254.86	3.43	so I feel like I have the worst luck with layovers.
259.29	4.91	And usually my first flight would just be delayed and then I can't make my second flight,
265.38	3.03	so I'm really hoping that's not the case this time.
270.77	11.79	The layover is in Orlando, so I suppose it wouldn't be super bad if I had to stay there longer, but I also hate airports, so we shall see.
282.74	1.5	Hopefully, I'll fly in time.
285.64	7.08	I also need to book a flight back because I guess that slipped my mind and I haven't really booked a ticket yet.
294.17	0.86	But we shall see.
295.27	3.52	I can't really decide where I want to stay to study.
302.47	10.2	Hopefully, I'll just get it all done and then I can just have the rest of summer off, and then maybe go to Boston for the conference before starting wards.
313.03	1.55	That would be ideal.
317.75	8.98	But I'm kind of nervous with starting wards because I feel like I currently know no knowledge, so we shall see how that goes.
328.95	1.73	Hopefully it wouldn't be too tiring.
331.08	10.8	It's kind of scary talking to the M3s because they all just seem so tired, and then they think that the first two years is super easy.
342.87	5.99	So, I'm kind of sad that I'm kind of leaving the easy period of my life and then I have to start clerkship.
353.62	5.67	And yeah, so I'm not really sure what other shows.
360.61	3.4	I'm really excited to watch TV shows.
364.78	6.03	There are a few shows that I've heard really great things about, but I've never really got the chance to watch.
372.08	1.36	I think White Lotus is one of them.
374.08	3.44	But I'm not really sure what it's about.
377.93	3.63	It sounds similar to Black Mirror, but it's on HBO.
382.87	2.05	But I don't really have an HBO subscription,
385.11	7.06	so I'll just ask one of my friends who have HBO and then I can start watching it.
394.67	8.61	I think it's good to find a TV show to sort of watch when I'm eating dinner because then I feel like that's a time where I can relax.
404.64	6.08	But I could also start watching sketchy videos during dinner,
410.99	5.85	but I think that would be super sad to just watch sketchy videos instead.
420.35	13.64	Some of the most memorable sketchy videos I've watched are definitely the Staph Aureus ones with the Egyptian, that's really memorable.
435.61	2.87	And also, the baby one.
439.97	2.45	I feel like it's the first few videos I watched.
442.56	6.4	I remembered really well and then all the other ones I don't really remember as well.
452.18	3.22	But it's okay, I feel like with time I'll just remember it.
458.8	5.48	Another show I want to start watching again is Grey's Anatomy.
464.78	7.35	I think that would be super fun to kind of get back to where I was, the season I was on.
472.54	4.57	I can't really remember what season I stopped at.
477.44	6.16	I think it was season 10, or whatever season that Derek Shepherd died.
483.88	5.89	I was really sad when he died and then all the other characters also went away.
491.09	6.66	And then I also feel Meredith really annoying, so it's really hard to continue watching Grey's Anatomy just for her.
499.7	11.16	I heard that from friends who are up to date that Meredith is actually leaving the show, so maybe that might get a little better.
511.04	10.93	But I feel like having 16-17 seasons for a show is kind of long, so I'm very surprised that the show is still going on.
523.2	8.07	But it's always kind of like a mindless watch when you just don't want to do anything and just watch something for fun.
535.76	6.44	I feel like there are some other shows that I really like watching, I think it's called The Sinner.
544.37	3.27	It was a really short show.
548.68	1.57	I think it only had like 3 seasons,
550.57	3.37	but I binge-saw it in like a span of 2 weeks.
554.08	3.13	So that was really good.
557.8	7.44	I don't know what other shows there are that I want to watch, but I think maybe I'll start making a list.
565.69	4.99	I think that would also be fun to watch with Keith when we do Netflix parties,
571.05	10.2	because then we can never decide what we want to watch and then we just spend the majority of our time discussing what we want to watch instead of actually watching anything.
582.7	3.31	So that would be nice to kind of know what to do.
589.45	3.22	I wonder if there's anything on Disney Plus that I can watch.
593.54	1.9	I haven't used that platform in so long.
597.53	9.7	But I thought it was kind of funny that Netflix had this thing going on where they said that.
