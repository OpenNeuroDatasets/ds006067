3.36	5.73	Well, taking the bus down here this morning was actually much nicer than I thought it would be.
9.23	6.18	I've never used public transport before, well, at least not here at Hopkins.
16.72	5.96	When I lived in St. Louis as a kid, we took the train and everything, but I've never used the JHMI shuttle before.
23.6	3.91	And it was honestly a lot faster and more convenient than I thought it would be.
27.56	5.62	You know, I put a lot of priority into having a car here when I was first a student.
33.3	14.5	I had a car by the second semester of my freshman year, and honestly now I feel a little bit silly for having done that because of the MARC trains that go to DC and the JHMI shuttle that runs to Peabody and to downtown here.
48.44	9.71	You could honestly do a lot without ever needing a car, but I'm still glad to have it to get out of the city, hike and go places that it's harder to reach with transit.
60.27	1.45	The bus was really clean.
61.88	5.5	That was surprising given Baltimore can really be a filthy city most of the time, honestly.
67.4	6.78	That was surprising for me as a student here, for not being a huge city.
74.2	2.39	Baltimore is really, really dirty.
76.92	2.04	I don't know if people here have a thing with littering.
82.16	5.77	It was cool driving by and seeing the monument, seeing Peabody, the Washington monument.
89.51	1.55	I really like that part of town.
91.22	6.7	I go to the Walters Art Museum a lot, and then the Maryland Center for History and Culture is basically right next door.
97.95	3.63	It's just really nice to live in a city with those resources.
101.75	3.52	I like a lot of the things about where I live in Vermont.
105.31	2.77	A lot of rural life is nice.
108.15	7.13	It's peaceful, but you definitely don't have the resources that you get in a place like Baltimore.
117.12	11.37	Yesterday I had the last part of my class, an intersession class I was taking that was a three-day seminar that involved going to DC.
128.91	5.08	Just like today, I took the MARC train for the first time and then the bus today.
133.99	4.08	So, it's been a lot of new public transit experiences.
143.32	0.62	But honestly, they've been really positive, a lot more convenient than driving a lot of the time.
145.26	4.2	Talking over this scan is frankly kind of annoying.
149.68	4.5	I mean, it's not unbearable, but it's definitely a loud sound in here.
154.89	5.68	Although this feels more tolerable than the last study I did here, honestly.
162.71	2.12	In my memory, that was much louder.
164.86	4.72	I don't think I had as much sound insulation around my head as I had had then.
170.35	16.77	I also don't think the air conditioning was on in the MRI at that point, so having this airflow in here plus the sort of sound deadening around my head makes this experience a little bit nicer.
187.12	1.49	Pretty nice weather today.
189.32	1.79	I always feel, you know, funny.
191.13	2.44	It's like the first thing I'm inclined to talk about is weather.
193.79	4.11	It's such like an old person or like a country thing to do,
198.18	3.59	but it's always the first kind of topic my mind goes to.
202.5	1.34	But it's nice today.
204.16	12.1	You know, definitely not used to having above freezing temperatures in like January and February, or being able to go outside and walk around without a ton of annoyance.
220.49	13.37	Yeah, as part of the course I took this week, there's been a lot of food provided, including some at restaurants, which has been just so nice to eat real food instead of dining hall food.
235.49	5.47	And it does feel like I'm finally getting my money's worth out of Hopkins for once.
241.03	5.95	You know, it always feels like your 80 grand in tuition goes pretty much nowhere.
246.98	3.08	Like the housing is pretty, pretty minimal.
250.12	1.98	The food is okay, but it's not great.
252.21	13.49	And the campus resources at least are at Homewood or, again, they're good, but they don't really seem like they warrant hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in tuition money from students.
265.88	13.19	So, I'm guessing a lot of that goes to like the physics lab and to the medical campus, places like that, which feels a little bit unfair, obviously, to the undergraduate population.
279.11	6.36	But I can understand that certainly most of the really important work isn't really going on at Homewood.
285.6	2.05	So that does kind of make sense.
291.31	4.65	I got a new backpack recently that I've been hoping to use for some travel.
295.99	4.37	It's like a light, you know, kind of 30 liter day pack sort of thing.
300.45	1.34	But it's been nice.
301.8	9.69	I've been using it to stay in shape for hiking, by waving it down and going for walks around Baltimore, it's nice to get outside.
311.55	6.71	But then it's really great in a cardiovascular exercise sense as well.
318.36	2.54	More than you would think from just walking.
321.24	3.52	But if you add enough weight, it really does make a big difference.
325.46	2.59	As far as exercise and cardiovascular health.
331.92	3.85	Honestly, the AC in here is quite cool, quite good.
336.99	2.86	Like I could have left my jacket on and I would probably be fine.
340.05	2.97	But the jacket has metal zippers and whatnot.
343.07	3.95	So, I don't know if that would necessarily be okay to have in here.
348.68	7.19	The MRI machine itself is also not as claustrophobic as I remember, having the the mirror and seeing the screen.
356.27	5.7	You know, like I can feel airflow around my upper body and my legs are out of the machine.
362.08	1.76	So, it's really not too bad.
363.87	2.88	It's not as bad as it's described a lot of the time.
370.72	7.24	I can see a little bit of like, I don't know, a black mesh sort of thing outside the machine, maybe on the wall.
378.48	3.85	It's kind of hard to get the perspective from in here because of the mirrors and everything.
389.56	11.7	I'm really looking forward to next year, moving into an off campus apartment and the change in living circumstances that that comes with, especially the bed.
401.77	5.29	A lot of stuff about the dorms is okay, but the beds are just really nasty.
407.1	7.36	There are these tiny little twin mattresses that are a few inches thick and not super comfortable.
414.5	5.6	Well you have to add a lot of padding to them, mattress pads and blankets and whatnot if you want to be comfortable.
421.38	7.74	So, I'm definitely looking to bring down my mattress from home, and actually getting a good night's sleep for once.
430.01	15.69	My apartment faces a parking garage for the hospital across the street that's constantly lit up with these super bright LED lights 24 hours a day, which I hang like a blackout curtain over the window, which helps a little bit.
446.2	5.77	But it's so much lighter than what I'm used to at home because there are no street lights.
452.03	3.71	You know, there's really no natural light at night at all.
456.24	3.62	So that's always an adjustment to make in terms of sleep quality.
460.98	8.61	But yeah, my lips are getting a little bit dry in here from all this talking.
477.04	6.96	It's nice too in Baltimore, the trees keep their foliage, some of them keep it year round.
484.06	2.26	It seems like they don't even have to be evergreen.
486.38	4.92	Some of the deciduous trees just keep their foliage all year, which is really nice.
491.32	2.57	It makes things feel a little bit less dead in the winter.
494.38	2.14	I like winter at home.
497.35	11.42	But it does feel, if there's snow on the ground for five or six months, it can start to feel really dead for the middle of that in January and February.
509.14	1.65	There's no plant life anywhere.
511.28	1.11	It's freezing cold.
512.82	3.29	It just seems like this kind of wasteland, this barren tundra.
516.78	0.6	So this is nice.
517.4	12.24	This is much nicer, having the grass and the trees, and everything kind of stays alive even through the winter.
529.64	11.42	It seems like I've been thinking because of a position I'm going to have in the next semester about crime around campus, it's going to be relevant to that.
541.2	12.01	It seems like things have been a little bit better so far after coming back here in the spring semester than they were last fall, which is good.
554.98	7.59	You would kind of think that crime would decrease a little bit in the winter, that people might be a little bit more subdued because of the weather.
562.73	5.47	But it did seem really bad in November and December of last year.
568.64	2.82	Like that effect didn't really seem to have taken place.
572.92	5.36	Definitely looking forward to summertime again, though, even though it gets so hot here.
579.69	5.46	Everything feels even more lively, obviously, in the spring and summer than it does in the winter.
588.46	5.51	Focusing on this little white cross is kind of starting to blur the edges of my vision.
594.08	8.2	If I focus too hard for too long, the gray edges of the screen start to get hazy a little bit.
