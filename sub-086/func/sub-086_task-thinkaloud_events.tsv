-11.03	2.17	All right, here I am.
-7.39	2.51	Honestly, I thought this would be more of a...
-4.36	2.05	I mean, I thought it would be claustrophobic.
-2.28	2.76	I've never been inside a scanner, and I thought it would be very weird.
0.9	1.66	But honestly, this doesn't feel so bad at all.
2.68	3.5	I mean, it's pretty good, there's a good wind and it's lying down here.
6.61	6.0	And I feel like honestly this is probably because my right earbud was off, I felt the noise was too loud.
12.65	8.22	And I was just thinking that maybe if the noise is too loud, how do I even listen to what's being told to me, and how do I even remember what I'm being told.
21.44	3.44	But honestly now it feels really nice and it's all right.
25.45	15.76	And it's just funny because I almost regretted taking the 8:30 AM slot today morning because I just woke up and I was like, I have to take the bus at 10:50, but yeah, I did it.
41.32	4.77	I woke up at 7:10 almost, barely.
47.68	14.41	Had a quick breakfast, and then I almost missed the bus because I did check the time, and by the time I checked, it was already 7:49, and the bus is at 7:50 and I ran, and I saw the bus, and I had to run for a couple of minutes, but I made it.
63.43	6.26	It was cold, and I was cursing myself, and I was like, God, he can't just be a little bit more punctual.
69.73	1.84	But honestly, it doesn't matter.
71.68	3.46	I mean, I feel like this is something that I always struggle with since I'm very bad with time management.
77.6	0.86	I don't know why I'm like this.
78.54	1.24	I think that I do...
81.5	4.82	I work pretty well, but generally when it comes down to things like this, I always procrastinate on some stuff and I...
87.71	12.18	Yeah it's kind of funny because when I had the interview with Arthur, and at that time maybe it was just because Arthur was just kind of judging me and in some sense kind of just making sure that I'm doing the right thing.
100.6	6.38	I kind of felt pretty hard to kind of verbalize what I was saying because I just felt sort of peered in and now it's...
107.61	0.69	Everything's all right.
108.38	2.89	It feels like I'm able to do whatever I want.
112.21	7.69	And honestly, I'm not too surprised by this because I generally like talking, and I feel like I almost talk more than what people need.
122.98	4.09	I...this doesn't feel bad at all, yeah.
128.4	0.28	What am I going to do today?
130.14	5.26	Once I'm done, I have a friend who's right here, who's working right here in the lab this close to this campus.
136.29	1.9	Maybe I can go see her lab if she's there.
138.52	0.96	That might not be a bad thing.
139.99	2.5	She works in zebrafishes and she works in zebrafish larvae.
143.03	4.74	And yeah, I've been wanting to see the zebrafish larvae for a very long time.
147.83	4.77	And honestly it's a very cool system, right, because it's completely transparent.
153.32	11.73	Like and it's...I feel like it's a very cool system, especially with the modern age of research where you just need more and more cells, and we kind of know that it's not just the single neuron activity.
165.1	3.46	But more of that is the population activity of the cells, which determines...
170.11	6.9	And I feel we are leaning, going in that mote and more, in that direction of the population activity, kind of gives us a lot of information.
177.62	12.3	And I feel like the cool mean study from that, I mean, one of the studies which I really, really like is from the Canadian lab, and from the Edward Bolson lab where they looked at the activity of the narcotics and hippocampus.
191.35	0.88	I thought it is so cool.
192.74	6.76	It's kind of insane, [indiscernible 00:04:04] be involved in some sort of giving contextual information.
199.52	2.67	But people didn't really know what it did.
202.76	4.72	Even when they measure the singular activity, like activity single cells, it didn't even make any sense.
208.33	5.35	But then what they did was, they looked at the population activity, and they looked at the population activity involving cells.
214.6	5.0	And they found this very cool thing that the whole activity can kind of evolved over time.
220.6	8.18	And when the other one is doing like cyclical things, let's say like going from one place to another, and like going in a loop and going back.
229.31	6.19	And it's kind of like the whole activity as a population kind of just, just reset.
235.9	6.68	And it kind of gave some sense that like it was including relative time.
242.64	3.03	And I was very fascinated by that work.
245.72	9.76	And I feel like zebrafish might be a cool system to do stuff like that, especially because I am for a summer school this time at a place called Marine Biological Laboratory.
255.55	4.98	And it was the most amazing time that I've had, like I met really cool friends and it was really, really fun.
260.65	3.74	Like it was the best time that I've had, like honestly it gave me a lot of confidence in what I'm doing.
265.61	6.98	But yeah, the reason I was talking about it was because there was a PI there who worked on C elegans.
273.01	2.18	And C elegans especially is a very cool system.
275.23	1.63	Because I didn't really think about it, because I generally think about behavior from a more, maybe I have a bit of a, I know in some sense, attitude if you say, like talking about it.
277.01	15.7	Because I've always worked with higher model systems, and I didn't really think too much about like these systems.
293.23	6.66	But here again, there was this one guy who worked on imaging all the neurons of C elegans, like as the animal is doing a natural behavior.
299.91	2.18	So it's reproduction or it's just foraging.
302.16	2.27	And that's, it's kind of nuts, right?
304.47	7.16	And I feel like it comes down to basic neuroethology principles, like there's no system that's perfect, right?
311.79	6.28	And you kind of figure out what kind of levels of analysis or what kind of questions that you're interested in, and you just do that.
320.04	10.05	Yeah, and it's funny that I'm talking about science, but yeah, I'm excited about this and I feel like it's a really cool time to do science in general.
331.32	3.84	But yeah, maybe I'll go there, I'll go see the lab and they have this really nice set up.
335.51	2.1	I've seen the pictures and I want to go and see that.
338.13	1.59	And then what do I do?
340.08	0.6	I want to go back.
342.94	0.86	I want to go to the gym.
348.78	1.25	I like going to the gym a lot.
350.08	6.9	And I feel like it's kind of a nice stress relief in some sense.
358.54	5.87	I was always fat and then I was disappointed.
364.45	0.69	I'm like, okay, I'm done.
365.2	1.51	And I'm like, no, after that it's just painful.
367.03	6.26	I feel like I kind of do it right now as more of a stress relief in some sense.
373.83	3.7	And it's really nice because I have like a bunch of people who I meet every day, and it's really fun.
377.57	2.79	And it's kind of like a nice push back to again just a break from that.
380.42	5.12	But I feel like I'll go crazy if I can't go to the gym for a while.
385.82	11.87	In some sense, it's kind of like a unhealthy addiction in some sense, because I feel like, let's say if I have an injury or something like that, if I can't go to the gym for a while, I am going to have a bit of an issue.
397.73	8.67	And I feel like it's kind of weird because the way that I start to speak is like I wanted to be healthy.
410.51	3.29	It's nice, but I don't want my life to go around the gym.
416.4	0.95	That's not really nice either.
418.0	4.47	I feel like I've struggled with this a bit in the past because I was just too addicted to this.
423.19	5.91	And the only thing I want to do is like, I kind of centered my life around working out, and that's not really super nice either.
430.52	2.51	But, yeah, I want to go to the gym and I'll go in the evening.
433.07	5.26	And like I am thinking of going out of my apartment this year.
438.82	4.18	And so, I think I'm going in with a friend, Coco.
444.5	3.29	And so, we're going to go see a house.
447.91	2.45	I think it's somewhere in Hampton, and I feel like Hampton's a nice place to go.
450.8	5.82	And I feel like the main issue that I've had with Charles Village, that's where I live right now, is just like it's a studio apartment.
457.11	4.07	It's an apartment and it's very undergrad vibes, and I feel like I'm kind of done with that.
462.78	1.77	But yeah, so it'll be nice to go and see an apartment.
464.57	2.72	I feel like this is an apartment with like three people.
467.38	3.29	I think it's meant for three people, and we don't have three people.
470.88	1.41	It's just me and my friend.
473.38	6.14	But at least it'll be nice to just go and see what the apartment looks like, and just see what a good house looks like.
479.56	1.56	At least the photos look really nice.
481.18	2.95	So, I am looking forward to that.
484.19	1.01	And I feel like it'll be and...
485.68	2.56	And oh, shit, it's going to snow today.
488.91	1.43	It's kind of cool.
490.59	0.71	Honestly, I don’t know.
492.68	1.2	I don’t know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
494.15	2.46	Because it hasn't snowed at all this year.
499.16	0.87	Honestly, it wouldn't be bad.
500.24	2.84	Honestly, I'm looking forward to the snow, if it actually snows.
503.89	1.97	And it's kind of crazy.
505.99	6.29	Like yesterday, it was just insanely warm.
512.61	11.71	Like it was a summer again, and now it's kind of crazy to see how rapid effects of climate change are.
525.59	1.61	It takes me back to my childhood days [Inaudible].
529.94	0.85	I'm from Keela.
531.1	4.76	And Keela is very weird because it's, what am I saying?
536.24	0.96	Keela's really nice.
539.9	7.21	In my childhood, we used to get these monsoons, it rains every time from June.
548.31	0.84	It kind of used to be crazy.
549.38	6.62	Like every year, June 1st, it’d start raining and it would just rain.
558.53	3.7	From June to like end of September, it just rained every day.
562.26	3.06	And it's kind of crazy, and it is just so predictable in some sense.
565.4	4.72	But now over the past few years, it's just kind of gotten to the stage where it's just so weird.
570.45	0.74	It doesn't snow.
571.25	2.73	It doesn't rain at all, I'm sorry- it doesn't rain at all.
574.89	1.95	And it's very unpredictable.
576.9	6.96	Sometimes you have rain early on in the year, and sometimes you have rain later in the year.
583.9	1.67	And that’s kind of messed up.
585.61	5.99	Because Keela is a place where there's a, it's a coastal area and there're a lot of houses.
591.79	3.5	There're a lot of people who live right next to the coast.
595.99	4.81	And so, when was it, 2017, 2018?
