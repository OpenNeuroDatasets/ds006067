1.41	5.84	I was thinking, if you think about how Sand is right, Sands of Time.
7.61	1.22	I was thinking about the Prince of Persia.
9.43	1.14	I actually kind of like the movie.
10.84	5.83	I like the idea of being able to travel back in time and actually come back in order to see like a previous mistake.
17.19	5.3	But then at the same time, it kind of takes away from the idea of being able to understand like the mistakes that you've made.
23.13	7.75	It kind of makes you want to reflect on life and make you want to be a better person at the end of the day. Because you know you can't change the past, but you know the future is always multiple.
31.52	15.87	And then at the same time, I kind of like the way the storyline went because he went back in time, but because he went back in time, he changed so much that he didn't like how much he changed. So, he kind of like continued to find himself in the situation that he didn't want to be in.
48.07	3.86	And I thought it was funny because it's how I see my life sometimes.
52.29	3.88	I feel like I want to change a lot, but I always want to move and improve.
56.72	0.93	I always want to become better.
58.37	3.31	I always want to inspire people to be like the best version of themselves as well.
62.23	2.67	It just makes me want to be a better person at the end of the day.
65.99	3.4	And I think that's just how I start to live life now.
69.94	17.19	You start to integrate things that you find from different movies and different things, and it all just ties them back to the same idea, like how do you utilize your time as a useful instrument, as a useful type of currency, similar to money?
87.49	2.49	I think that's how I think about it.
90.44	12.24	Like if you have so much time in the world, like so much time to do things, you can utilize that time however you need to, but utilizing that time however you need to is kind of how it should go.
102.94	14.71	I feel like maybe along the way, I probably find out that there's a lot more going on in life than I think it is, and I'm just waiting to find out. At this time...
119.78	11.93	I feel like, especially with the study of the brain, it's kind of like one of those things that I would like to utilize my time to do because not a lot of people understand their brain, and that's why they probably keep writing so many books on it.
132.52	3.81	And you kind of figure out a lot of things that work.
139.79	4.12	I just really want to understand why do things work the way they do.
145.5	7.17	At times, I just see things be however they want to be, however they should be, but is that really how they have to be?
152.94	1.81	Is like structure really what it is.
156.16	4.76	Is it all just like packed up sand, put it to one place like concrete?
161.28	4.04	Or is it like another aspect of life that I just haven't yet to see?
172.21	9.21	I woke up today and I didn't do anything for a couple hours, and I felt ashamed for myself because you got to keep working.
182.05	0.73	You got to keep going.
183.64	4.04	Like if you don't go, if you don't keep going, where are you going to be at the end of the day?
188.31	3.31	Already, you don't have a lot of things to do.
191.81	4.52	You don't have a lot of like time release, and you have a lot of people that you want to spend time with.
197.5	2.05	I know I felt kind of bad actually.
200.33	2.5	Maybe I should go see my bigger brothers today, or something like that.
204.18	6.89	I mean, I haven't seen them in a minute. I've been so far away from them. I don't know.
211.52	4.17	Sitting in a library, I just kind of sit here and think about nothing.
215.88	2.93	I do the work, but at the same time, am I really learning?
219.31	1.42	Am I enjoying what I'm learning?
221.27	1.41	Am I enjoying the why I'm learning?
224.4	1.95	I need to reconcile with myself.
226.53	1.18	I need to figure out what I want to do.
227.99	7.16	I need to balance myself, figure out what I need and what I want to do, and then do it.
235.97	2.67	I can't rely on motivation anymore, motivation doesn't help.
239.46	3.22	I kind of just got to accomplish.
243.45	5.49	I just got to step forward, step beyond the hump, go beyond myself.
250.62	1.45	It kind of reminds me of Anime.
253.52	7.07	I want to be like all white, just like plus ultra, go beyond, something like that.
265.13	0.88	A gray screen.
266.23	1.85	Why a gray screen?
268.44	3.67	I feel like gray is such a unique color.
272.47	4.31	I mean, it's such a blend of things.
277.33	4.26	I feel like gray is so bland.
282.77	13.79	If they could be white. Maybe if they could be a splash of color, something, it'd be a little more interesting. Because I see things black and white anyway, but I want it to be more colorful, more expansive.
297.82	15.29	I guess it's just the all or nothing mentality. Like it's either you got to do it or you're not, and it's kind of just how things work. But it doesn't really matter, and just like spend your time just thinking about how things should work.
314.19	3.86	I probably should have eaten this morning too, but that's fine.
319.13	2.95	I mean, I just I have things to do and I have to get up.
322.33	6.8	I mean, I didn't have anything to do, but I think this is something I want to do, maybe because I want to do it.
329.31	0.82	That's how a show works.
341.23	4.52	I don't think I get nervous, but I mean I feel like nervousness is a thing. I don't know.
346.05	5.24	I think I'm maybe a little nervous, because I don't know what they might find.
352.47	11.11	I feel like there's a lot that probably goes on in my mind, and I have my own thoughts about what I think about, and then what my brain looks like, what it could look like.
366.44	9.02	I'm actually kind of worried, 8.5 or something that shouldn't be there. But I don't want to hear that news, but at the same time I do want to hear that news, I want to be informed.
377.46	6.35	Maybe that's why I took my time to read the entire contract, maybe I don't know.
388.03	1.58	It makes me feel like I want to rap right now.
390.25	2.58	Something I'm going by nature, maybe like a freestyle.
393.56	17.64	It's a little fast, but you could get a lot of words jumbled up in your head, kind of put it together, put like a poem actually, kind of in a philosophical way.
411.75	14.42	It's just the way of life. How much can I ignore, how much can I not ignore, how much can I pay attention to, how much can I see, how much will I continue to work with, how much will I not continue to work with?
426.85	3.67	I think it all just works in its own self, it all works in its own intuitive way.
432.15	3.77	I have a neuroscience exam coming up soon.
436.25	11.29	I got to study for it. And I need to go through the lectures, actually talks about secondary messengers and CaM Kinase 2.
449.4	4.58	And I also got to manage my time in terms of making sure I do my probstat homework today.
455.16	1.77	I don't know if I studied that.
458.2	0.72	I mean, did I study?
459.1	0.77	I don't think I did.
460.24	2.27	I should have studied it.
465.09	2.59	I also got to study for the MCAT.
468.22	0.82	See what's up with that.
469.76	1.65	But do I have time?
471.47	0.82	I don't really have time.
474.5	1.09	I just hope I don't fall asleep.
475.95	3.95	I had like sleeping things and then problems with sleeping and stuff like that.
483.03	1.4	It's all about how it works.
485.52	5.49	Hopefully, do something right for once.
492.02	3.49	For a long time, there's a lot that goes on in my mind that I really don't understand.
497.1	0.73	I go through a lot.
498.19	1.72	Why do I go through a lot?
500.86	4.04	A lot of times I feel like I could go through much worse, but I'm not going to be much worse.
505.26	1.27	I kind of do this to myself.
508.03	5.67	I put myself in situations that I don't really want to be. But then at the same time, I put myself in situations that I feel like I should be in.
514.15	1.95	I feel like everything has its own consequence.
516.56	1.86	Maybe its own consequence is just probably how it works.
519.05	9.3	And we're just always here, just in my head wondering, what if something I did affects somebody in a way that I didn't want it to affect them?
528.98	5.4	And I was thinking about how I was chilling with my girl, like how does Layla feel about this?
535.44	2.32	I mean, I haven't seen her in like two weeks.
538.21	1.09	Maybe I should go see her sometime.
539.66	2.13	I'll probably go take her out on a date or something like that.
542.54	3.77	I feel like it's difficult in my mind.
548.21	5.26	It's like she wants me to do a lot, but I don't know what she wants me to do. But we don't communicate about it.
553.84	2.23	I mean, maybe I should just talk to her about it.
556.25	0.93	Maybe I should ask her something different.
557.45	1.18	Maybe I should start asking questions.
559.72	2.64	I mean, you start asking questions, maybe that's how it works.
562.58	3.58	Maybe she is just giving me answers in the first place, or maybe I should just be more attentive.
567.84	2.36	It just makes it kind of difficult because I'm trying to work with her.
570.7	1.81	I need to work with her.
573.24	1.22	No, I know what to do.
574.82	4.75	I mean, I would try to take her out of the feels, and if I take out the feels, maybe Topgolf.
579.68	0.9	Topgolf is a good idea.
580.81	2.0	Topgolf is a great idea.
583.44	0.86	I mean, I have a membership.
584.67	0.99	But I just haven't gone.
586.03	6.78	I've been wanting to go, and then apparently, there's one that's downtown, so maybe the one downtown, but I don't know.
593.01	3.58	Maybe it's just because. At the same time, I just need to focus.
596.96	0.45	I need to focus.
597.77	0.15	I need to focus.
598.47	3.67	If I don't focus, then I mean it's probably not going to work.
