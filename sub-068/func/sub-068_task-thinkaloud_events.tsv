1.85	5.71	I am going to have a movie night with my friends tonight, so that's going to be really exciting.
8.52	7.79	We watched Knives Out last week, but tonight we're going to watch Glass Onion, which I watched before and I really loved.
16.41	6.03	So, I'm really hoping that they'll also love it, but they liked Knives Out, so I'm assuming they will also like it.
23.07	5.04	I'm not a big movie person, so they usually trust my movie recommendations.
28.65	11.88	But I did also like Everything Everywhere All at Once, which has 11 Oscar nominations.
41.48	1.19	I'm so excited for them.
42.76	3.44	I really hope they win all the Oscars because they really deserve it.
46.46	2.83	It's such a cool movie, visually and artistically.
49.74	3.13	And it has such good themes and messages.
52.96	2.72	And it really was an impactful movie.
56.59	13.11	I tried to get all my friends to watch the movie, but they're not always up for watching movies with me, even though they should watch movies with me because I only have good movie recommendations.
71.1	4.63	But I also need to go to the store later and get some food.
77.13	2.35	So, I need to figure out when I can.
79.98	4.47	I'll probably go after this scan to the store to pick up food.
84.85	16.15	And then also I need to get some flower pots because my plants started sprouting, and so I should probably just get the flower pots now so that I don't need to worry about that later when they're outgrowing their current sprout pots.
101.73	19.35	And I should probably also pick up some more, I don't know if I can pick that up at the store, like some sod for my rabbit because he really liked the grass thing I got him online, but I don't want to keep having to order grass online when I can just buy that at the store.
121.17	14.97	But I don't think they sell sod in small quantities because when I looked it up online, it seemed like they only sold it at like $500 like amounts, which I'm not spending $500 of my rabbit, not yet at least.
136.69	9.75	When he finally gets neutered, then I'll have to spend like $500 because medical procedures cost so much money, but yeah.
146.62	12.24	I think I might be able to ask some of the vets at work to do it for me, but then I would have to ask some of the vets at work to do that, and they're always so busy, so I always feel bad whenever I have to interrupt them with non-work related things.
159.45	6.94	So, it's like every time I tell my boss that I need to do that, she's always like, oh, just ask the vets, and I'm like, but they're so busy.
166.57	1.86	How am I supposed to just ask them?
169.02	15.38	But I'm sure there're some residents, so I'm sure they'll want the residents to practice something like that because the residents don't really ever get to do like simple procedures like that, or at least procedures that should be simple.
184.8	15.51	But then yesterday at our meeting, my boss was talking about how it's actually a pretty invasive procedure for monkeys, so now I'm worried that it's going to be a very invasive procedure for my rabbit, and that it's not going to go well.
200.49	5.95	But also, he needs to get it done because the hormones are just insane.
207.16	4.54	So, it's something I need to get done, but I keep procrastinating.
212.1	1.64	And that's something that I've always done.
213.92	1.5	I need to stop procrastinating.
216.19	8.89	It's something my mom always critiques me on, but she's also a procrastinator, so she doesn't really have much light to stand on.
225.94	4.58	I get it from her, like family traits and whatnot, but I don't know.
232.24	1.54	I should probably call my mom.
235.0	4.77	Yeah, I talked to her yesterday, and she seemed good, but she's also been really stressed out at work lately.
239.95	6.4	So, I should probably just talk to her about some fun things so that she can take her mind off the things.
247.07	2.9	Yeah, work has been stressful for a lot of people lately.
250.6	8.26	Even my coworker, granted, her stress levels is just like through the roof with everything going on in her life right now.
259.31	5.13	I feel so bad for her, because literally everything is going wrong for her.
264.98	3.36	She's such a sweet person, I don't want things to go wrong for her.
269.07	2.81	But hopefully things will get better.
272.33	7.44	I knew January was going to be a tough month, so I just got to take it one day at a time and hope for the best.
280.76	7.43	My sister ended up getting a new car recently, and I'm still confused as to why, but I guess their truck broke.
288.2	9.3	But that's not that surprising, because it was one of those stupid lifted trucks, and those things are not built to last.
298.31	3.18	They're really annoying, please.
302.28	2.99	Ugh, they're so big and annoying.
305.4	6.65	And granted, she doesn't live in the city anymore, so it's not that bad, but it's also like, you don't need that.
312.6	5.4	So, now they have a simple smaller car, and hopefully that'll actually last them.
318.77	6.61	But it's also, I don't know why they got the truck in the first place, they barely need it.
325.42	0.84	They don't need a truck.
327.6	4.4	Most people who get trucks don't need trucks, I've come to realize.
333.22	1.66	And it's just, I don't know.
335.38	0.86	I don't like trucks.
336.33	0.77	I think they're stupid.
337.46	4.63	They're hard to drive, and they make driving worse for everyone else.
343.31	2.31	Except the normal trucks.
346.17	6.53	The normal, shorter trucks that actually people use for pickups and stuff.
353.06	5.58	But they have those extra large pickup trucks nowadays, and they're just so big and tacky.
359.18	1.14	I think they're really ugly.
361.09	2.68	But who am I to say?
363.95	5.76	I don't have a car, which I'm kind of glad about, because cars are so expensive.
369.98	4.85	And I'm lucky that I have a bus that will take me to work, so I don't need a car.
375.38	4.8	But it does make going to the store a lot harder, but you know, you make do.
380.63	5.21	And I don't have to worry about parking in the parking garage, which is definitely falling apart.
386.02	7.98	It's concrete, but it's also covered in rust, and there's a ton of water damage.
394.59	4.25	So, anytime I have to go down there, I'm like, this is it, this is when I'm going to get murdered.
399.4	6.12	Which is unlikely, because no one's ever down there, because it's really scary.
405.61	10.62	And I feel like it's going to just fall down one of these days, which is not great, because a lot of cars, it's just not going to be great.
417.04	7.89	Also, there's a weird sign there that is like, don't be a victim, and I feel like that is a horrible sign to put out there.
425.38	3.54	It's very dystopian to me.
430.02	3.9	Oh, and I really want to reread The Hunger Games.
434.96	6.31	I need to go to the library and get a library card so that I can reread The Hunger Games, because I don't want to buy The Hunger Games.
442.27	4.05	And plus, it's good to support libraries and actually get a library card.
447.06	3.1	So, I need to do that soon.
450.57	7.03	I keep telling myself to do that, but it's not open on Sunday, and every time I remember to go to the library, it's Sunday.
458.14	2.36	I don't know why the library's not open on Sunday.
460.95	15.51	My library back in Chicago is open on Sunday, so I was not expecting the library here to not be open on Sunday, but it isn't, and that's something that confuses me a lot.
476.55	5.95	Sunday seems like a good library day, to go and pick up a book and just read.
483.04	6.39	But I can't pick up a book if I don't remember on Saturday to go and get a book, but whatever.
492.06	0.55	I can't.
492.79	2.22	I should also, I need to go to the park more.
495.19	3.99	I guess I'll do that more when it's more sunny and warmer out.
499.73	2.9	I'm still expecting there to be a ton of snow.
503.45	8.84	Going to school in Minnesota for years, it primes you for snow, and so I'm like, it's January, where's the snow?
512.47	0.82	And there's no snow.
513.88	16.32	It also didn't help that my other boss was like, yeah, we're going to have a bunch of, in case something happens this month, we'll have, the school gave us permission to rent out a hotel so that everyone could go to work.
530.93	7.94	And it's like, I'm waiting for the bad weather she told us about that was going to happen, and it hasn't happened yet.
539.77	8.17	So it's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop or we're going to get like three feet of snow, but I don't think that's actually going to happen.
548.62	4.67	But I'm still waiting for it because it's winter.
553.38	0.86	Where's the snow?
554.88	13.06	And it's so hard moving to a new city where you don't know what's normal, so it's like, is this no snow normal for Baltimore, or is this a weird climate change thing?
569.53	10.61	Because when it doesn't snow in Minnesota, then you know something bad is happening, because it always snows in Minnesota, that's like their thing.
580.96	3.71	And like Chicago too, it usually snows in Chicago.
586.35	4.45	But they're just now getting their snow, and it was a pretty dry winter.
591.52	9.75	And having a dry winter is not great because the trees need, they use the water from the snow for the spring.
